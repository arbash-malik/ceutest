"Devine Restaurant Coffee Bar","19 Vine Street, London EC3N 2PX England","#2 of 15,800 Restaurants in London","5.0 ","(577)","$5","$10","This is a hidden gem – at the time of writing, you can cut through past the Silver Tiger statue. Otherwise, find Minories and follow Hammett Street around to the right and into the Crescent, then under the railway bridge. Look out for a sign...set high on the wall, as the entrance door is tucked back at an angle and easy to miss.

The cafe is a great space – large yet relaxed and cosy, clean and comfortable. Sid, the owner, is a lovely guy – attentive and happy to chat, but not in the least bit pushy. He clearly takes a lot of pride in his business. (And rightly so!)

The cafe was fairly busy with the tail end of the breakfast crowd, but we were seated and got our menus promptly, and drinks soon arrived while we chose our food. The cappuccino was exceptional – nice strong coffee, and lovely thick foam that lasted to the end. (Like a dessert in a cup – in a good way!) I couldn't manage two, but the tea (builders'-style) I had later was strong and refreshing.

We both had the V3 breakfast with extra black pudding. Good-quality bacon cooked until slightly crisp but not dry, a lovely herby sausage, tasty baked beans, an 'over easy' fried egg, and thick toast. The black pudding had loads of flavour and was perfectly cooked. Last but not least, 'proper' chips – thick-cut, fluffy on the inside and crispy on the outside. 

In short, the café, staff and food were all fantastic, and we intend to come back soon! Highly recommended!More","Date of visit: November 2023"

"Kinaara","1 Waterview Drive Greenwich Peninsula, London SE10 0TW England","#3 of 15,800 Restaurants in London","5.0 ","(334)","$44","$95","My much better half treated me to dinner at Kinaara for my birthday the other day, and I can hardly imagine a more wonderful gift. The food, the place, and the team were (are!) amazing. We loved it.

We were seated at a beautiful corner...table with a view of Canary Wharf and Docklands, with their reflections glistening in the river. The view alone is worth a visit, but when the food appears and we see each others’ smiles at what we are being served, the view is but a pretty little distraction.
 
The amuse-bouche really did amuse (our ‘bouches’, I guess). It supposed to be little teaser, and, oh, does it tease. A delicate, light play on corn, it is both wonderfully subtle and a slap in the face, telling your palate “strap in, hold tight, you’re here for an adventure”.

A few reviews had mentioned the grilled broccoli, and how surprised they were at something so simple being so spectacular. Well, they weren’t wrong. They’re a triumph: hint of smokiness, a hint of spice, just enough crunch, and yet so comfortably smooth and soft and, excuse me, sexy. Outrageous. 

Slap the word tandoori in front of anything, and I’ll be certain to try it. It doesn’t always work, but give a great chef a tandoor, and, hey, presto: Magic. These chefs definitely know what they’re doing. A bit like a good pizza oven, it does a lot of the work, but you still have to put in the effort, and the right ingredients, in the right order. 

The tandoori prawns are as glorious as they look. The missus ;) knew that although we’re sharing all these marvellous dishes, there was no chance I wasn’t going to have most of the prawns. I love good seafood, and this is seafood at its very best. 

Being from Azerbaijan means growing up with a lot of lamb dishes, and usually, as in her case, becoming quite picky and curious about other interpretations of lamb. She chose two lamb dishes. Considering she married me, you’d be entitled to question her choices, but not these. This time, she chose well. 

The dainty chops, the lamb starters, Lamb Barrah, were just lovely. I looked around to make sure I don’t embarrass myself and saw a guest at another table picking up a lamb chop as it should be picked up and gnawing at it. This is not a dish that should be eaten with knife and fork alone. You want to have every last bit of spicy, juicy, crispy yumminess. These little lambs did not sacrifice themselves in vain.

Of course I had to order a biryani. Some of my best friends are Gujarati. Some of the best meals I have ever eaten were biryanis. This one, Dum Pukht Chicken Biryani, the one with the pastry lid, is right up there with the best of them. 

Our other main, the lamb shank, Lamb Nihari, is a joke. It defies physics. How? Just how? How does it stay on the bone just long enough to reach our table and then fall off? How does it stick on the fork and then melt in the mouth like a meaty toffee?

And while I ponder the impossibility or, at the very least, unlikelihood of these dishes, my darling dearest has a taste of the Dal Makhani, dark and creamy lentils from heaven, and gives me a knowing look. This is good, really, really good, she tells me - without saying the words. Thank you for taking me here (with words), and thank Zana for recommending this.

And before it gets too repetitive - it was really was that consistently great - and just after briefly noting that the desserts were sensational too, may I just mention that although I loved it all, my personal culinary highlight, the dish that was most for me and most like me, was the unlikely okra, Masala Bhindi: Humble, but arrogant, subtle and yet brash, with a bit of bite, but also unashamedly a little slippery, not to everyone’s liking, but, well, liked, somehow.

I blame it on my partly Turkish roots. Okra is a delicacy in Turkey and it is also a delicacy by virtue of it being delicate. Even slightly overcooked, it becomes a gloopy mess. Slightly under, and it’s torture, like the sort half-cooked beans English restaurants used to serve. I have had okra many many times. My dad is an okra expert and he makes damn fine okra dishes. We disagree and argue a lot, but on this we agree. This okra, Kinaara’s okra, ‘our’ okra is wonderful. It’s life-affirming. 

Occasionally, I have had people tell me that they don’t like “spicy” food, and I try my very best to be polite, respectful and understanding, but on the inside, in my mind, in the deep recesses of my soul, I pity them. 

I believe that the two great national cuisines, if there is such a thing, are Italian and Indian. Yes, there is good and even great food in all sorts of places, but considering the quality of food I have eaten both in restaurants and in private homes, the pride in the ingredients and the preparation, these two cuisines are quite clearly exceptional. I have travelled a bit and eaten a lot (plus I’m ridiculously old) and with my family from or in four continents, I know that is quite a generalisation, but I know it’s true.

I had a great aunt, god rest her soul, my nan’s brother’s wife, who was from Bangalore, and who introduced me to her cuisine when I was just a toddler, and, yes, it was by far the best food I had as a child - or since. She lived in Germany for most of her adult life, and whenever we visited I would spend hours with her in the kitchen, as she cooked and cursed the lack of proper food or ingredients in the shops, or laughed and sneered at what Germans and other Europeans called “curry”.

And, yes, the use of spices in Indian food is very pronounced. But to describe Indian cuisine simply as spicy, or even ‘too spicy’, is ridiculous. What great Indian food demonstrates is that spices are ingredients among many others, elements within a dish, prepared with attention to detail, with intricate timing, using all the various traditional and modern techniques and tools to create something delicious and nutritious. Not liking food because it is spicy, is no less silly than not liking food that is marinated, food that is properly cooked, made in stages rather than just thrown together randomly, or, frankly, food with any discernible taste.

The food at Kinaara is just that: bursting with taste, made with great care, with discernment and discipline, with deft, delicate touches, with experience and expression, prepared, presented and served by excellent, thoroughly pleasant professionals. 

We were served, expertly, by Varun, and welcomed by Diveena and Soniya, and both Zana, the fabulously charming restaurant manager, and Mohan, who manages all the restaurants and bars at the hotel with a lovely blend of pride and humility, came to greet us, all of whom made it a memorable experience for which we are truly grateful.

We cannot wait to go back, although it will be a real struggle to decide whether we try the other great sounding dishes on the menu, or ordering these again, renewing our wows.More","Date of visit: February 2023"

London has many options, but if one is anywhere near the O2, skip the venues near the arena and visit Kinaara on floor two of the intercontinental hotel. The restaurant has two glass walls overlooking the Thames, the...prime meridian (marked at night with a green laser) and part of the  London skyline. The views are spectacular. The restaurant  is even better. 

Kinaara is exceptional. It is very welcoming and the staff are outstanding, and the food is delicious. I have eaten in many Indian restaurants and never seen the cuisine presented as elegantly as it is here. I have also not enjoyed such a complexity of flora. Indian sauces are complex but Kinaara    does something special. Make a reservation and enjoy a relaxed evening of delicious  food. 

More adventurous dishes include the broccoli, which is spicy and amazingly good. People who feel less adventurous can not go wrong with the Butter chicken. The garlic naan is exceptional. 

The first evening, we had a group of 7 and “Ashish” waited in us and the second evening , we were just a couple, returning to try more dishes and our waiter was “Roshaan.”  Both men are professional and very knowledgable about the wines and the cuisine.

They even let us try a dish we were contemplating. As a vegan, I ordered a selection of veg side dishes and the flavours of the dishes were amazing.

The night we were there...we had 1960's West Coast jazz - what's not to like? The volume is just right, too - loud enough to have a presence, not so loud that you can't have a conversation.

All the staff was super friendly and informative. The atmosphere in the restaurant was comfy and relaxed. I tried the Bruce Beef burger I was not disappointed at all the flavors and juiciness was just mouth watering. They also have curly fries! so was a win win for me.

The burgers, and we had a variety, were top notch. 

Being a fan of flame grilled burgers made from scratch at home, I was really pleased to see the chef going through the process, down to making the dimple in the middle of the patty! Bruce's personality is part of the experience! The decor is also pretty cool-looking.

I will definitely return, as no doubt will the ""kids"" (20-somethings). Thanks Bruce + Team.

This burger joint is a hidden gym in north London (Tottenham). I usually go to east London to eat my burgers but from today that stops! Bruce burgers is fantastic! This burger joint is definitely up there with the top spots. Firstly...the owner is very welcoming and he gives you an excellent customer experience. Plus the chefs pull their weight and also give a comprehensive customer service. I got their fully loaded burger and boy oh boy it was spectacular juicy with so much flavouring that when I took a bite, I had to stand up and just wait for my taste buds to acknowledge what fine food it had tasted. The wings as well were by far the best I’ve ever had!! It was marinated to perfection and so succulent that it made me deep why I wasted my money on all the other restaurants I’ve been too in the past. On top of that, the owner has made a private room at the back so if you ever want to have some time with that special someone, you can.

I’ll definitely be visiting again and again and again. Well done to Bruce burgers! You thoroughly deserved this review! Keep up the awesome food.More","Date of visit: October 2023"

Firstly, I don't think I've ever been greated or treated so warmly by any owner and his waiting staff ever in my life. Abdul and his young colleagues are simply exceptional and making you fell welcome and highly valued.Secondly, everyone in there appears to be a regular - always a good sign I always think. The place was virtually full, and it wasn't even 7pm - on a wet Monday night!! Most important of all of course - the food is simply delicious. I left it to Abdul to recommend what I should eat. And it was not only great tasting, but good value and good size portions. Not charging corkage for my BYO wine was also a very nice feaure (again, not something I've ever seen elsewhere). You should definitely try this place. No wonder it gets five stars from pretty well everyone who goes there. It certainly does from me. Can't wait to go back.More","Date of visit: November 2023"

   There are Bengali specialities not usually served at many restaurants for the  discerning . I  love Lamb  Dansak, my husband has Chicken Tikka ,which arrives  sizzling on an iron plate , and we share king prawn Bhuna and a variety of vegetable dishes and an assortment of rice and naan  breads .

For us, early risers, it is a bonus that Taste of Nawab opens at 5.30pm . The restaurant fills up fast, so its best to book if you want to be sure of a table.

As we looked at the menu he assured us he will take care all we needed, and oh yes he really actually did that.
Starting with the right...choice of wine - directed us to the wine closely aligned to our taste and by my surprise not the most expensive and truly what we wanted ! Superb wine and reasonably priced and most important to us authentic Greek wine. Rare find!
After that we’ve decided to go with his advice and did not disappoint!
The starters, selection of everything you want to try fresh and Greek just was there on the plate in no time. Nothing was too much of an effort ..and just kept getting better and better. Mains, left to Mario (the person who made this experience the one) brought selection of grill so fresh and tender.. just another world! The flavour of the chicken and lamb were truly something i’ve not  had for a long time. Must try !
Pudding .. baklava with ice cream and incredible unique way of serving coffee.. just when we thought it can’t get better, It did! Ah , yes and that ultimate Greek shot of liquor so unique.. well can’t describe it as you have to try it! 
We’ve left the place with a thought of can’t wait to go back again, do it all over again and share with the rest of our friends and family .. and we will !More","Date of visit: December 2023"

Poppadoms arrived promptly 5 mins after order, followed very swiftly within 5 minutes by my main course. Chicken was tough, suspect reheated given the relative quick time it was served 

When challenged...I was told by the waiter that he was told when to bring my main course out. My response was that he was front of house and thus it was his role to control the delivery of food and ultimately ensure the satisfaction of the guests.

Admittedly they didn’t charge for the poppadoms or main course which was a good gesture however I would have preferred a better experience. On receiving the bill, I asked for a VAT receipt to be told that he couldn’t provide one as the Manager wasn’t on shift that night!!!!

Everything was delicious, the only thing we weren’t too keen on was the spinach fatayer which we found a little sharp and could have done with a little more cooking probably however the edges were a little scorched. However this took nothing away from the meal. We enjoyed pudding and coffee with baklava over a lovely, relaxing two hours, never feeling rushed.

The menu is 'right sized' with just a few dishes per course to allow enough attention to get each one perfect. 
And they succeed. The pre-dinner nibbles arrived early to stave off...the hungries, and were all fresh delicious and Italian. 
All our mains were perfection, pasta cooked to exactly the right texture and the ragus tender and succulent, and wonderfully flavoured. 
We couldn't resist desserts and these all hit the spot as well. Tiramisu sounds like a standard, but mine set a new standard. 
Two of us tried an Ichnusa unfiltered Sardinian beer which surprised and delighted us as an accompaniment. Delicious. We were served efficiently but still with a delightful personal touch that made us feel almost like family. 
A perfect, relaxed, evening out.

They were not wrong, simply the finest Italian food we have ever eaten. The welcome we received was friendly...and with good humour, the menu was explained to us alongside a number of specials that the chef had added for the evening. Carmelo the chef came to our table to discuss the specials and welcome us too, we knew at this point that we were in for a treat and how right we were. The presentation and taste of each dish was simply out of this world, a fusion of flavours served alongside fine Italian selected wines.  If you haven’t visited yet then it’s a must, we may live three hours away but this will not be our only visit, we arrived as diners but left as friends, that’s how good the hospitality is  and thus will most definitely be back.

The place is cosy and yet well presented decor wise. Service was impeccable  - thank you Ariel and team - as for the food....what can I...say...my husband and I adore eating out and have been to many restaurants both in London and outer London and I can simply and truly say that Lizzie's is all about fresh and authentic ingredients. The flavors and combinations were amazing and we all enjoyed the dishes we picked. The sicilian Chef Carmelo  is truly top notch, he is definitely a true professional and boasts many years experience within the culinary field. Every dish was cooked to perfection and of course the presentation was also very traditional and pleasing to the eye - the crockery is typical Sicilian which made you feel like you were eating out in Sicily!
Franca the owner was very sweet and funny, you can see she really cares about ensuring her customers are satisfied and leave the restaurant happy and well fed which in my opinion is of paramount important as nothing could be worse than spending a substantial amount of money down the drain and this is certainly not the case at Lizzie's, the money spent was well worth every penny! My family and I will defintely be returning and we have already recommended friends, colleagues and other family members to give Lizzie's a try as we know they will not be disappointed!!!

The pilau rice is light and fluffy and not heavy.  The lamb jalfrazi which is not on the menu but I asked (chicken is).  Was also tasty and just the right heat (though I could have wanted it spicer a personal preference).   The naan was light and not heavy either.  

The onion bargi was cooked to perfection and not soaked in oil, which sometimes you get with other places.  

For a lunch this place is spot on.  Shame that I live so far away but will definitely pop in again for lunch.  12 mins on the tube from Waterloo.  4 tables in before 2pm on a Saturday lunch - never known of this before.

"Tower Tandoori Restaurant","74-76 Tower Bridge Road, London SE1 4TP England","#28 of 15,800 Restaurants in London","4.5 ","(2,063)","","","Had friends visiting from Norway and this restaurant was walking distance from their hotel and took a chance on the already glowing reviews. We went in for 7pm and the restaurant was already over half full and some Christmas parties were already well underway. Sadly...the noise was a a little off putting for our visitors as it was difficult to hear each other, let alone the background music. But this was a minor setback and it is that festive time of year. Can’t moan at people for being in the spirit and enjoying themselves. 

The decor was contemporary whilst donning some cultural pieces giving the venue a modern twist. The lighting was fine but a more chic, and table centric spots would have gone great here. The place felt slightly larger than your average tandoori restaurant which allows them to have larger square tables which were set in diamond formation as oppose the usual linear set up. These tables are certainly a plus, especially when all the food comes out. 

The staff were very attentive, polite and very knowledgeable. Being served by a various table staff, this did not deter our service and the front man was very welcoming and clearly took pride in what they do. Service was prompt yet never felt rushed and all the staff were eager to please, offering suggestions and change in spice levels. 

The food was good, tasty and well presented, but whilst the menu was again contemporary and interesting with some inspiring dishes, it lacked the typical classics which some curry munchers might find disappointing. The boast about vegan options but is very limited with the main courses and we were advised that certain mains could not be altered. Portions were ample and they have a good drink selection with the usual beverages. 

Overall a good place if you’re in the area and would certainly return if south of the river again in Bermondsey.More","Date of visit: December 2023"

I have been to this restaurant so I am very aware the portion sizes are huge. So for my 9 and 6 year old I ordered a normal meal for them to share. The waiter took...our orders and explained that the table needs to spend a certain amount (baring in mind there isn’t a kids menu). When have you ever been to a restaurant that tells you how much to spend? The manager was rude and quite disrespectful. He was more interested in making money than providing a service for his customers. He refused to provide his name when we requested to make a complaint. 
So we kindly left the restaurant and ate somewhere else where they simply take the order and serve the food without question.More","Date of visit: September 2023"

Research led us to this excellent restaurant.  First impressions were very good and we had a warm and genuinely cheerful welcome by...- as it turns out - one of the joint owners.

The table was well presented with a cutlery rest, sparkling cutlery and glasses and lovely napkins.  The Wine List is top end with a wonderful selection ranging from affordable to very definitely extra special “occasion”.

The Dishes were explained and were based on Northern Italian cooking.  We had a couple of smaller dishes which were generous portions and beautifully presented.  My wife started with the Soup while I had the Veal with a tuna and anchovy sauce.  Both dishes were perfectly prepared and presented.

Our second dishes were Ravioli and Stuffed Pasta ( a mix of 3 meats ).  Perfectly cooked and great to look at we were delighted with our selections.

In addition to our food we had a bottle of sparkling water and tea and a latte.  We refused the offer of bread and any alcoholic drinks. We spoke with the Chef and “Boss of Front of House” and they were keen to hear our views on the food.

It is not cheap but it is superb value for money when one considers the quality of the food.  It is not that easy to park on the Street but it is, most certainly, worth travelling to eat there.  We’ll be going again when we’re next in Rome for a few days.

There are traditional Piedmont Dishes but also some modern twists and you can be assured of a fine performance in the Kitchen and a warm and informed welcome.  They are getting established and deserve to be successful.More","Date of visit: November 2023"

We ended up going with the servers recommendation of Saiko Sashi beef from Greece. Never heard of that, but it was amazing. 

Also tried the patanegra burger. Wow. Had patanegra once at an upscale place in NYC. Never heard of it on a burger. It’s kind of amazing the high quality ingredients at Bufalero.

"Ambrosia Rooftop Restaurant & Bar","Via Nazionale 22 Located in Hotel Artemide, 00184 Rome Italy","#15 of 9,282 Restaurants in Rome","4.5 ","(1,806)","$44","$82","This is the hotel's bar and restaurant atop the Hotel Artemide.  We dined her on our last evening at the hotel, in part to save ourselves further walking for the day. Plus, we'd been interested in checking it out.  Our first challenge was getting there....The hotel has a front tower and a rear tower, apparently. The restaurant is accessed via the elevator towards the back of the hotel, near the entrance to the breakfast room. Once we figured this out, we were able to find the restaurant. The only other challenge was that the elevator opens both its doors at the top floor, so be careful you proceed the right way (the opposite door from which you enter, as I recall). 

The weather had turned slightly cool and rainy when we visited, so they did not have their exterior rooftop area open for dining. That might be nice in warmer weather, though. I think we called ahead by 30 minutes or so to ensure a reservation. That may be a good idea, especially if you are not a hotel guest. I'm not sure if they get preference or not. 

The overall vibe I got here was semi fine dining and bar scene.  The clientele was almost exclusively American tourists the night we visited. That may vary from evening to evening, though. The menu was less pasta and more meat and game centered. They may also have had fish. I still got a pasta dish that I enjoyed. I don't recall specifically what others in our party ordered, but everyone like and finished their food. Despite the lively bar / cocktail scene, we did not order any. 

Prices were slightly above what we'd paid in other local restaurants, but not radically so.  I thought pricing was reasonable vs. the higher tier of service here. This place might be a bit of a splurge, but the quality of the food and service (and presumably the drinks too) make it worthwhile.More","Date of visit: November 2023"

No doubt, many of them would like to attract dining customers from outside there guests and why not with a rooftop restaurant...with gourmet aspirations? Can't blame them for amping up their websites to attract more trade.

There are some very good things going for this one, and some that don't quite make the grade. First and foremost, their chef/kitchen brigade can cook, and the dishes we had were all first rate. The wait staff is mostly young, eager to please and the kind of people you would like to know. The wine list is decent and other than some purposely placed overpriced bottles quite acceptable.

So, why all the caution? Let me go into some detail, and you decide. We arrived a half hour before our dinner reservation and asked if we could have a drink in the bar. A very pleasant young lady verified our reservation and offered to take us to the outside rooftop bar or inside one, both right next to the dining area.  We decided to go outside (on a cool November evening to savor the view.  From the time we sat down until our drinks arrived was a good 20 minutes, just before our reservation time. Not to be late, we asked if our drinks could be brought into the dining room and they graciously concurred. The drinks, by the way were Campari/Orange, very heavy on the booze, with no signs of the orange and looked more life refugees from a Tiki Bar without the umbrellas. After drinking about a third, we abandoned them and asked for glasses of Rosati, which were quite good.

The menu was as advertised; attractive, well executed dishes with both style and substance. We very much liked our conscientious young waiter and swapped some travel stories. 

Frankly, the ""rooftop"" restaurant looks like an upgrade from a less upscale effort, and one that isn't entirely successful.  The furnishings are more bar/coffee shop grade than fine dining.  The windows are too high to really see well outside, and candidly, the view is not that special. Even the outside bar area is a bit underwhelming compared to many other venues in Rome.  There are a few wall hooks for coats, and as the meal progressed, our coats got buried further and further in the scrum. Quite suitable for a gym or athletic club, but not a higher end restaurant. 

We are more interested in the quality of the food and the welcome, and in those aspects, they are fine. Orchestras and bands need to play well together. The timing, bar and restaurant, are not in synch here. A pleaasnt meal, but everyone is not on the same page.More","Date of visit: November 2023"

The food is fantastic and presented beautifully. The four of us had the pig, duck, tuna, and porcini.

There's only one man in the restaurant (you can see him in all photos) who appears to be a chef, a waiter, a cleaner... He can't do all these jobs on his own, that's...why the service is terrible. They don't welcome their guests at the entrance. People are queuing for 10-15 minutes outside and leave. The menu is very small and has nothing special. Moreover, the traditional Italian dishes that they serve are far from ideal, compared with other places in Rome. We wasted at least one hour only waiting for the meal after making the order. We ordered only vegetable starters, green salad and bread. The bread costs 1,5 per person, and we never got it, though we asked for it, and it was included into the bill. We asked for the bill a few times but then just got up and went to the kitchen/bar to pay for our 3-hour ""vegan"" lunch. After that we went to another place because we were hungry and frustrated. The place isn't worth your time and money. Plus, it's very dirty there, we were surrounded by dirty plates left by other guestsMore","Date of visit: November 2023"

Based on my experience I was hoping it had survived the Pandemic and saw that it did. I made my choice of hotels in Rome based...on it  being open. As soon as we checked into our hotel after a long day and a half of travel, we freshened up and headed there. Our hotel was next door.
It changed a bit. It was busier and have fewer sandwich options but a spectacular menu of the best pasta dishes you could want. I mean Michelin quality meals such as Ravioli with pesto. Such a creamy pesto based sauce and delicate and delicious ravioli. My wife had that and I tasted.
I was going to have Cacio e pepe when my wife saw the fettuccini with oxtails and I got my order changed just in time. On a scale of 1 to spectacular, this was off the charts!  A lot of folk are squeamish about some cuts but put your fears behind and try this.

The food is made to order of the highest quality with creative presentations and really large portions for a price much lower than you would expect to pay anywhere in that location.

It closes after the lunch rush is (chef and his wife work non stop when open) so go early and enjoy. You may have to wait but hold up the number of fingers to indicate the size of your party and they will get you in as soon as possible. 

Too often we have found great restaurants that have bowed to the pressure to be a tourist and lost their quality. Stay firm chef and keep serving your high standard beautifully presented meals.More","Date of visit: November 2023"

We both ordered from the specials board. I got the carbonara tartufata and my wife got the fettucine funghi cardonetti.  Both dishes were extraordinary, but I have to say the carbonara tartufata will...be a lifelong memory--up there with a 2 hour meal I had many years ago in Alsace, France.  I saw them shaving the truffles onto my pasta for some time. It was a masterpiece. So sad I do not have a pic. We will return on the next trip to Rome for multiple visits. Once for another special and again for some of the standard Roman dishes to see what they should really taste like. Go and enjoy!More","Date of visit: November 2022"

The food at this restaurant was outstanding as well. The carbonara was a standout, and we also indulged in a delightful little table with ham, cheese, and prosciutto that was absolutely delicious. Every dish we tried was top-notch.

The restaurant itself has a cozy and inviting atmosphere that sets the stage for a wonderful dining experience. It's the kind of place that encourages you to relax, savor your meal, and enjoy some drinks.

They would not ask you if you’d like more to drink if your glass was empty, so you had to work hard to get in contact with one of them to order new food or drinks. For the mains we ordered the brisket (very disappointing) and the lobster sandwich. If you order one of the most popular dishes i think it would be very good, but i would not recommend the dishes we chose.

Andrea, the owner, was very friendly and loved to tell me about his restaurant and the different pizzas that were being made.  I intended to stay for a quick bite and ended up waiting...for several fresh pizzas to come out of the oven, one after the other.  Each one was different, but they were all topped by high quality ingredients and the flavors really came together nicely.  Each one seemed to be better than the one before it.  The one that stood out from the rest for me was the Pizza Bianca, simple dough, sesame seeds and olive oil.  It surprised me how good it was given the lack of other ingredients, but it was the perfect one to show how good the dough is by itself.

We have been here in Italy for a month and trying pizza all over the country.  I was apprehensive about the Rome Pizza as I am a big Neapolitan pizza lover (I have my own pizza oven...at my home in the US).   Casa Manco will make you a convert!   This is a small stand in a farmers market outside the Rome tourist areas.    They have premade pizzas on display and they heat them in the oven when you order them.  1st the crust was terrific, with dough raised for 4 days.  The dough was airy throughout but the same thickness from the crust thru the middle (not like Neapolitan pizza that are thick at the outside and thin/barely cooked in the inside).    That was the 1st wonderful part of the pizza, but then the toppings were unbelievably good.   The sauces, cheese, and toppings were Over the top.  Every bite was better and better.   My only regret was we didn’t find this place until the last day before returning to the US and they don’t ship pizza (yet!).   Take a taxi or bus here.  You will not regret it. OBTW there is a wine stand right next door to the pizzeria stand.  Great glass of wine for 2.50E!!!!!More","Date of visit: October 2023"

Some of the streets we walked through weren’t that great but we’re so glad we kept on walking. 
It’s not a pizza restaurant, it’s a booth in a covered market....We traveled from the train station to Casamanco on our last day. We rode and walked there which took us about 1 1/2 hrs. We weren’t disappointed. 
We chose 4 different types of pizza, my partner ate one before I took the photo!
We took a ticket from the machine and waited about 1/2 hour. They even freshly made us a slice of fig and Parma ham pizza as they had run out. 
We sat inside the market at a table and had 2 mojitos as well.
The drinks were €10 and the pizza was €20. The pizza is sold by weight and won’t be the cheapest you can buy, but for us it was by  far the tastiest. The pizzas are covered with lots of wonderful quality ingredients. 
We had a meal the night before which cost €70 and it was very ordinary. For us this was our favourite meal in Rome.More","Date of visit: October 2023"

The menu was accessible using a code on the table. 
Variety of drinks but not the usual coke, Fanta, etc. We opted for carrot ginger...beer, and that was very nice. There are a mix of fruit mocktails available. Didn't look at the alcohol drinks. 
Cauliflower wings to start off with, accompanying dipping sauce, and we loved it. 
Blind Date burger was supposed to be so like meat you wouldn't be able to tell the difference. I would agree to disagree but it was delicious. Came with home cooked fries. 
The Oh My Hot Dog did taste just like a hot dog though. 
The food came quickly, as did the drinks. 
Efficient and friendly.
Only here for a week but will hopefully go back. 
45 Euros, the tip was automatically included, but we left a little extra.

We debated the omakase dinner, but decided to go a la carte. This restaurant is best for people who are serious about their fish and don’t expect fancy rolls with lots of sauce to cover up the fish. We...lived in Asia and visited Japan frequently, and feel this restaurant has more in common with Tokyo sushi than with American sushi. The freshness of the fish combined with a beautiful presentation made the dinner memorable. We would have loved to eat here every other night if we were in town for very long. There are 2 seatings, and we had the early one from 7:30 - 9 pm. The service was wonderful, but the fish were the real stars. We had the spicy shrimp roll (beautiful), along with lots of sashimi and nigiri. We also had the tuna tataki - the wafu sauce is wonderful.

Honestly our top favorite meal of our trip. The best sushi, nigiri and sashimi I’ve ever had. And I’ve been to Japan. 

Who knew we would find delicious sushi in Spain. Family...owned business, the owner is one of the sushi chefs and his family also works in the restaurant. 

Only 11 seats in the space so definitely get a reservation! 

We got the tasting menu $70 Euros per person and totally worth the price. We’ve paid double that in the USA, and not nearly as good or as much food as this. 

We got two tasting menus, a bottle of wine and two extra plates for $184 euros. Totally worth it!! 

Fish was so fresh, zero fishy taste. And it is tender and melts in your mouth. The flavors used are simple, but make a flavor explosion. Even the edamame was unique. 

The rice itself was perfect and balanced to the fish ratio. 

Will always recommend this place, and wish the owners the best and hope they expand!More","Date of visit: November 2023"

Up front they explain the menu to you, suggesting sternly that ordering from the fresh pasta page instead of the other boxed pasta page is the ONLY way to go. Please do not order...the pizza as we don’t have a wood oven. I always appreciate suggestions. However I don’t appreciate the waiter berating the ladies behind us when they began to place their pizza and boxed pasta selections. Again explaining why they really don’t want to order those things. Ladies awkwardly laughing and saying yes yes but I would still like to order what I want to order. I had thought about making a “bad” selection but didn’t want to listen to him. If I didn’t no better I would think they were aggressively pushing the fresh pasta as it was about to go bad. 
For our starter we had the focaccia and the burrata salad, both excellent. Then things went bad from there. My husband ordered the paccheri with calabrese on the fresh pasta side. No paccheri but we can serve with box pasta (?!?!). Arrived with no calabrese as that”desolves” here’s a thought but a couple of chunks on the top so that at least we say, see there is some instead of wow they sure are cost cutting. Oh and when it says spicy and the waiter suggests the dish cause it is spicy make sure it’s spicy. Not that hard. Oh and don’t forget to make fresh tomato sauce instead of what tasted like it came out of a can. My pistachio pesto was fine.

I had the Blu Bar Famous Veggie Burger, and my wife had the Ensaladilla Rusa. Drinks were the homemade lemonade which was very flavoursome.

Despite taking 30 mins to find this restaurant it was without a doubt worth it because not only is it a really nice traditional Italian restaurant but the staff were so lovely, friendly and welcoming which is nice. I ordered the pasta genovese and my mum had a pizza and oh my goodness that pasta genovese was INCREDIBLE!!!!! From the delicious fresh pasta which you can without a doubt tell that it's fresh and cooked to perfection to the gorgeous beef along with the onions but after one bite I said to my mum this is ridiculously good and I am quite picky with my Italian restaurants though this one my goodness their food is DELICIOUS!!!! My mum loved her pizza as well and it looked lovely!!! 

We got talking to the staff member (sorry if you see this I didn't get your name) but he told me it's a family run business and it was just so lovely talking to him! 

Tripadvisor where is there travellers choice award for 2023 because they deserve it! 

If your in Barcelona I cannot recommend this place higher and if we would of been here longer we would 100% of gone back again just for that pasta genovese as it was amazing but I know it takes hours to cook that so well done to the restaurant for perfecting such an incredible dish!!!!!

They were all small portions  but by the time we were finished eating, we were sufficiently stuffed and couldn’t eat another bite.

The tasting menu was overall well-thought. At the beginning they asked if we wanted a suprise menu or a menu we could look at, but you had...to make a choice without knowing what the other is. I get the play, but I'd really prefer to see both options. I I also would have like to see a written menu to better keep it in my mind. Also, you have to choose the same thing as the whole table.

I can't recall all the dishes we had but overall it was a considerate and interesting menu. The only piece I didn't quite see the need for was the cracker at the beginning.

We had the tasting menu and wine pairing, which was a nice selection. Overall we left full and intrigued.

What was also really nice was that they asked for any allergies/preferences and gracefully accomodated the allergy and gluten-free option for one friend who needed it.

What didn't work for me as much was the atmosphere. It felt a little sterile and wished we felt a bit more relaxed. What we also didn't really enjoy was the naming thing. When we entered, they asked for our names and while serving and introducing the food, they referred to us sometimes by the names. If you're a regular to a place- it's great to know each other by names. But for a place you come for the first time, it really felt not authentic and awkward- in that sense it served the opposite of what it probably intended to do.  And this contributed to that less relaxed atmosphere.

I think if the place feel a little bit more relaxed and natural, it would really elevate the eating experience.More","Date of visit: October 2023"

So, I made a reservation to dine once again at Con Gracia. We were happy to Jose and Sabrina again, particularly since other favorite places did not survive Covid. We chose the tasting menu; I had the wine pairing while my wife had a single glass of wine, apparently figuring she would get her wine tasting by taking part of mine! In short, every dish (5 main tasting dishes plus 4 others) was excellent and generally creative. They were also able to accommodate my wife’s diet restrictions. In reflecting on our experience, it occurred to me that they have actually stepped up their game from an already high level 14 years ago.

We happened to stumble across this restaurant as the place that we originally planned on going was closed, we are so glad it was. The service was amazing from the start, the...lady that served us was very sweet and patient with us, especially me as I was trying to speak Spanish after only 6 days of learning; she helped me pronounce a few things on the menu. The drink choice was good and well priced, I had a lovely house Rioja blanco and my partner was very happy with her sangria. The food was absolutely amazing, there were so many dishes to choose from that we wish we had a second night to try the rest; the two of us managed to eat 12 tapas between us as we were desperate to try as many as possible. Each tapa was well thought out and cooked perfectly. I would highly recommend this restaurant and I hope it gets the credit it deserves. Unfortunately, there are not a lot of reviews for this place so it doesn’t appear on most search engines unless you look for it specifically.

This was the perfect end to our holiday so I thank the staff for treating us so kindly.

Drinks - great
Staff - even better

This restaurant leap out at us.  Very highly rated by other reviewers.  A small, family-run tapas bar in the heart of the Gothic quarter.  You could easily walk past this place without noticing it, even if you could find the small alley...it's located in.

Long, thin, bar/dining area.  We had made a reservation and fortunately so.  The place was full.  By the time we left there was a small queue of prospective diners outside!

Friendly staff.  Great food.  Seating is on high chairs with bar tables.  Not particularly comfortable but gives it a less formal feel.  Everybody seemed very happy!

Thoroughly recommended.  Worth seeking out, but make a reservation.

The best bit is that it was only EUR 83.50 for two, including wine and service.  Excellent value.  You'd be foolish not to pay it a visit.More","Date of visit: September 2023"

We could *not* have been more disappointed. We started out with what seemed like...a wonderful dinner on the terrace, but after we ordered, the dinner went quickly downhill. We were treated like we clearly did not matter at all.

Our waiter disappeared for close to an hour with no one else taking his place to serve us. He did not bring the wine we ordered for dinner and when my wife received her dinner from the server and was very disappointed in the fish, she could not get a single person's help to order another entree.

Making things worse, when someone finally approached our table after 45 minutes and noticed that she had not eaten any of her food, they insisted that we file a formal complaint with the manager so that we could received a discount or refund before we left.

What then actually happened was the worst experience I have ever had a restaurant. We were forced to wait another 30 minutes for the manager to come out to our table and interview my wife as to why she did not like her meal. She then took the dinner from my wife, offered nothing in its place, and disappeared leaving us to wait. After another 15 minutes she returned to tell my wife that everyone in the kitchen had tasted her food (seriously?!) and all agreed that the fish was indeed fresh and that she was wrong. 

During this entire time, we had simply been trying to cut our losses, get our bill, pay, and leave. But instead we waited close to 1.5 hours to receive disappointing food, be ignored by our waiter and the other wait staff, and then forced to talk to the manager only to be argued with told that my wife was wrong for not liking her meal. And at the end of it all, we were charged for the glass of wine they forgot to bring and charged in full for the dish my wife did not eat - despite being told that it would be discounted or removed from our bill.

Given how expensive the dinner was, I'm still astonished at how we miserably we were treated and the quality of the food. I've never experienced anything like this at a restaurant in my life, let alone one of such high regard. No one should ever be treated this way - it was humiliating and inexcusable.More","Date of visit: July 2022"

When we came in to the restaurant, a lady came to take our orders. She told us that the kitchen was closing very soon hence we went through the menu...quickly to order, tho we had some questions and she became impatient, showed by her body gestures and sighs. She tried to maintain a friendly voice but we were already feeling very uncomfortable by her response as she was rushing to take our orders (they could’ve told us they were closing if they didn't want to take more orders). We ended up ordering big portions of the fish and chips and what they put as ‘steak’ on the menu.

We were super disappointed when the food arrived. The taste was okay but tbh it looked like frozen food. The ‘steak’ should be best translated as a beef burger patty instead. We were also surprised that they would charge for tab water (we later found 1 other restaurant in Switzerland who charges for tab water as well), and if we wanted to request for 1 more plate and fork. To be fair it was written on their menu but we missed it, still we felt it was quite ridiculous.

We would’ve been expecting a more pleasant experience in a service-based industry and treated with better customer respect, but instead we rushed to finish the food (just because we didn't want it to go wasted) and left feeling heated.More","Date of visit: May 2023"

My...wife and I both enjoyed fresh salads and fish plates.  The fish was caught in the adjacent lake, with crystal-clear water, and tasted delicious.  The beer is what you will find in other restaurants, and they also have liquor.

It's a small restaurant (probably seats 30 max) but has a real charm to it.  I could be mistaken, but it appears to be run by a husband and wife (could also be girlfriend).  In speaking with the chef/owner, we learned that is originally from Germany and cooked there for years before ""retiring"" to Switzerland.  His congeniality topped that of the waitress, and made for a great dining experience.

The restaurant was super crowded and full of diners, most of them were from tour groups of different nationalities.

The...restaurant is nice and cosy and we were lucky to sit next to the window where we could have a great snow mountains view outside. The sights were amazing and wonderful. 

But as they are trying to maximize the space, tables and chairs were arranged very closed to one another and thus making the walk in-out very difficult and it's squeezy.

After waiting for quite a while (the restaurant was very busy as mentioned due to high number of diners), our meals were served. It was a 3-course meal that consisted of soup of the day (with bread), the main course, grilled chicken with tomato puree and fries and cheese cake.

Overall, the foods were nice and cooked well and we enjoyed our meal!

Service wise, despite of the slow service, staff were friendly and humourous who communicated with us in our mother's tongue language (i.e. mandarin) and even joked with us.

And the washrooms are located at the lower floor which you will need to walk down a flight of stairs and is located next to the Indian restaurant.

We had the 7-course menu.  The struggle for the kitchen and the lack of agility with their menus was that we don’t eat seafood. Half the dishes...presented to us “usually had seafood part of them” and therefore the dish was essentially the accompaniment without the seafood (we were actually told this)!  Nicely presented but nothing memorable at all. I fail to recall any dish that I would say was signature or outstanding . I also had the non-alcoholic accompaniment with the courses. Each one was a fruit juice, which by number 7 was overwhelming and distracting. The restaurant has built a reputation on its setting, colourful plating and very high-price - seemingly convincing people it’s good because of those 3 things. However, this is not matched with imaginative dishes, kitchen agility or taste. Service was efficient and cold. The setting lacks warmth and atmosphere.

This was fine with us....The meal is the focus and all the dishes are beautifully plated. It is a set menu with a choice of the number of courses. There is some flexibility with a choice of vegetarian, seafood or meat (or some combo). As we were staying in the hotel, we dined there two nights, opting to go vegetarian one night to get the full range of dishes. But the soy butter pales in comparison to real butter from the happy Swiss cows. We do feel the chef's strength is in the interpretation of the vegetable and fish courses. The full vegetarian meal could do with a little bit more variety in taste in my opinion (but this is my view coming from a meat eater). Regardless, thoroughly enjoyed both our meals.

We ordered one beef soup ( 육개장), Tofu stew ( 순두부찌개), and sliced pork for BBQ. None...of them tasted authentic enough to say Korean. The stews had acidic flavor which resembled overly fermented Ghimchi. And when we tasted their Ghimchi served as one of the three side dishes, it was confirmed that it was the same Ghimchi flavor we tasted in both stews. 

Pork slices were ok since it was supposed to be raw, no seasoning involved, but the lettuce was broken up iceberg lettuce whereas for authentic Korean cuisine, leafy lettuce is served for any bbq meat. There was no other vegetable such as perilla leaves, peppers, cucumber and so forth.  

The meager three side dishes vaguely resembled some Korean dishes that are made with the same ingredients, but again acidity was the overwhelming flavor in them as well. 

In sum, if you must eat Korean, do not set your expectations high.More","Date of visit: July 2023"

However, I was taken aback how environmentally irresponsible this restaurant is with its policy not to serve tap water and compelling patrons...to buy bottled water, which may create misunderstandings with visitors that the water quality in Interlaken isn’t potable, when in fact it is some of the best in the world….

I asked for a glass of tap water with dinner and was told they only serve bottled water for 4,50CHF. Is this restaurant blind to the fact that these empties fill up SWISS landfills? Aare’s anti- tap water policy is horrible for the environment. I guess this restaurant can make bank by peddling bottled water. Do these guys know that Interlaken has some of the best tap water in the world? Profit over the environment I’m sure impresses the Greens in Bern and environmentalists. Are, please don’t trash this country w unnecessary refuge for profit and serve tap water next time I eat at your restaurant.

However, I am deeply disappointed with the customer service by waitress Debora. I came in without a reservation and when I came in, she said you can sit as long as you leave...by 8pm due to other reservations. Which did not make me feel very welcome at all as a customer (absolutely a bad example of customer service), but I thought it’s okay I will leave by then anyways. At that time the restaurant was completely empty, although by the end people started to come in. I had brought half a bottle of water that I intended to finish (since I was traveling from the US and was walking and thirsty), and she told me that I was not allowed to bring a water bottle from outside. I apologized for not knowing the policy (and perhaps not the cultural norms), so I quickly finished the water. She noticed the cup with last few drops of water and reiterated that I was not allowed to finish my water and got angry at me and gave me attitude. She then proceeded to serve a chocolate fondue without heating it up or even a plate, I had to ask her specifically to do that. And she ignored me throughout and gave me dirty looks when passing by me and took a while to give the check. She completely needs to be retrained and taught what proper customer service should be like, especially in such a nice hotel in a town which welcomes plenty of tourists around the globe. Very disappointed in the service, although the manager was kind enough to ask if everything was okay.More","Date of visit: January 2023"

We stayed in Interlaken and didn't have a car. We took the bus out to the Salzano and after a 3-4 minute walk we were there. (Note the busses don't run too lake going back to Interlaken so we took a...taxi back)

This was hands down my favorite dinner in Switzerland. Everything was either grown there, came from local farms (or trees), or fished right out of the river close by. Family run hotel and restaurant that truly love the area and utilize it everything they do in the restaurant. It's very warm and cozy in the dining room and you don't really want to leave.

We did the 5 course Alpine natural experience (which was more like 9-10 courses when all said and done) and just wow. Everything was amazing. Very Veggie forward but still great fish and oxtail dishes. I can't tell you what will be on the menu when you visit since it changes all the time but it's definitely worth your time and money.

Be sure to pick up some of their herb salts at the front desk, one of my new favorite seasonings. My only regret was that we didn't stay at the hotel!More","Date of visit: February 2023"

First night was from the ""gastronomic "" menu. Excellent. Wonderful and original presentations, excellent products, a real sense of originality. The place really deserves its gastronomic ranking. We enjoyed everything and the single remark from our...part would be that the overall impression was a bit to sweet to our taste: all plates had some sweet components, and very little or no acidity. It is OK but we think is brings some unbalanced overall impression. Maybe it is not the case all the time though. Anyway it was an excellent dinner, very enjoyable. 
Second night was from the regular menu, which was good to very good depending on the dish but nothing really remarkable. 
The only ""cultural shock"" was on the first evening... they offer 3, 5 and 7 courses dinner, but at 8PM only the former is available as the others take too long to prepare !!! We were told that dining at 6.30 PM would allow for the 7 courses menu. Dining at afternoon tea time is quite surreal for us coming from the other side of the famous Graben!!

Our waitress was super nice. She struggled a bit in French but we were already impressed by her speaking three languages...and having to describe elaborate dishes. Bravo to her!

We took the 5 course menu and were completely stunned by all the courses they brought out (we thought they mistakenly gave us the 7 course menu instead!). In total, we counted, there were 10 courses for our 5 course menu. This was due to all the ""pre"" courses. For every course, there was a pre-course. It was very copieus! We would have gotten the 3 course if we knew it was this much food so be aware if you aren't ready to eat that much! The food was delicious and very well presented.

Only a few criticisms: there were quite a lot of repeat flavors (goat cheese, beets, herbs). I understand seasonal cooking but I did feel like it was a bit repetitive. Other critic was on the service. Sometimes the runner would serve the food but didn't explain anything. It may have been a language issue but would have been nice to have the explanation each time since the dishes were so original (there were 3 dishes that we didn't get an explanation). I think the waitress must have been too busy. And lastly, some dishes came very fast, even too fast, whilst we waited quite a long time for the main and dessert. The timings were a little off provided the type of restaurant.

In all, it was a nice fancy dinner for our anniversary but not very Swiss, quite contemporary made from local products. It was worth the price for everything we got and clearly the attention put into creating the dishes.More","Date of visit: September 2020"

We had the Gyacok for 2 people: A mix of meat pieces (chicken and wonderfully-seasoned lamb), shrimps, Momos (steamed dumplings), and vegetables, served with basmati rice and thin noodles (like a vermicelli) in...a Tibetan steamer. We were offered a choice of ‘hotness’ level and we went for medium. The result is well-worth the 20 minutes extra preparation time as it is much lighter (fat-wise) than one would expect, and each individual morsel maintain its individual taste rather than the sauce/broth taking over.
We made the reservation a few weeks ago and our table was ready on time. Within 30 minutes there were many (maybe 20?) people waiting in line outside and that’s impressive as it was rainy!. A reservation is a must if you don’t want to wait. The wine list is very decent but we went for Cava Brut as we didn’t know what to expect in terms of how the food would taste, and it worked great.

Our visit exceeded every expectation, leaving us utterly impressed by the excellence of this establishment, its stellar staff, and the culinary prowess of the master...chef.

Bourgainville's commitment to perfection was evident in every detail, from the impeccable service to the carefully curated selection of exquisite wines.

The ambiance, the attention to detail, the superb wine choices – every element seamlessly came together to create a dining experience that will remain etched in our memories. As we left the restaurant, we couldn't help but feel overwhelmed by the sheer brilliance of it all.

After being named Trip Advisor's number one restaurant in the world, we had to try it.  Many restaurants would rest on their laurels, but it appears Restaurant Bougainville has used their exposure to elevate the restaurant even more

We started with...a drink in the Hotel 27 bar (highly recommend this, it's a beautiful setting and very creative cocktail menu with several unique signature drinks.  Once we moved into the dining room, we had the 6 course chef's tasting menu with the wine pairing.  Of course the 6 course tasting menu is more like a 12-14 course menu as there are starters, palate cleansers, and other extras.  The food is inventive while still being ""gourmet comfort"" food, and the wine pairings created by Ronald were spectacular.  The wine pairings were enhanced by him bringing us the wine first but not telling us what wine it is, then asking us to taste it, then bringing the food to taste again with the pairing.  After we were done with the tasting and pairing, he would present the bottle and explain everything about it and why he chose it as a pairing.  This way any preconceived notions of various wines did not detract from the pairing.  They accommodated a scallop allergy with a dish that was equally amazing. The service was spectacular.  I have eaten at many Michelin Star restaurants, and I would rate the food and service here more on par with Michelin 2 star restaurant.  It is the best 1 star we have been to.More","Date of visit: November 2023"

The place felt elegant, the service was amazing, the tasting menu felt approachable and the food itself was just delightful. Though the menu will change seasonally, the menu for...our dinner included sea bass, Opperdoeser Ronde potato, lobster, brill (fish), venison or wagyu upgrade and a peach or cheese upgrade dessert. 

We also included the wine pairing and it was kind of fun in that they brought us the wine in a decanter and then we’d experience it, try to guess what it was and then they’d come back to tell us about it. Wines were from all over the world. 

The only downside is that once the restaurant was filled up (even on a Tues night), the wait staff became a little stretched to keep up the same level of service as you’d expect from this caliber of restaurant, like having to wait for the wine pairing to arrive or water glasses going empty – but would still highly recommend this restaurant for an amazing experience.  Also, their dinner pricing was more affordable compared to other Michelin restaurants we tried on our trip, so if that was the trade off, it was worth it.  We were there for about 3 ½ hours.More","Date of visit: September 2023"

Started out with a cocktail in the Bar Twenty Seven. Service and atmosphere were both outstanding. I had the specialty old fashioned. Taste and presentation were wonderful....I highly recommend you give it a try before dinner. I was seated in the restaurant promptly at my reservation time and the whole epicurean experience began. Prior to seeing the menu I was offered a drink and some amuse bouche. Beautifully presented and full of flavor. For dinner I ordered the six course tasting with the wagyu beef as an extra. I was blown away by the presentation and flavors of each of the dishes. It would be very hard to pick a favorite as each dish stood so well on its own. The staff took the time to describe each dish as it was presented. I did not do the wine pairing with the meal, but I did ask for a red wine to go with the main course. The sommelier came over and discussed my likes and chose an excellent red wine that paired very well with my wagyu beef dish. The only slightly disappointing dish I had was the dessert course. It was listed as a peach dessert. Presentation was beautiful, but after the bold and outstanding flavors of the previous dishes I was expecting more from the dessert course. The taste was good, but it was not bursting with the peach flavor that I was expecting. The staff was very understanding of my disappointment with the dish and offered a replacement. By this time I was full and very satisfied with my meal and declined an additional dessert. Overall my experience was outstanding. I will definitely come back again on my next trip to Amsterdam.More","Date of visit: October 2023"

The resturant had a good setup which I believe is being run by people who have 0 knowledge of hygeine. The halal food certificate hung near the bill counter has expired in 2022. I made a big mistake going there and spending my money and time.

"Restaurant Zaza's","Daniël Stalpertstraat 103, 1072 XD Amsterdam The Netherlands","#15 of 3,566 Restaurants in Amsterdam","4.5 ","(2,104)","","","We had reserved a table a few weeks before and it was ready when we showed up a bit ahead of time. The settings and the ambiance are modern, very nice & inviting. The chairs are very comfortable, and there is enough distance between the...tables to achieve good privacy; also the background music was very non-obtrusive during our visit. The menus for food and wine are presented through QR codes; Julia and I are not especially fond of this approach for menus, however we are adapting to it as we realize that standard printed menus are sometimes difficult to read with low ambient light levels... They are also much more expensive to update, so maybe the QR menus are helping restaurants keep the costs down?

The food menu is not especially expansive (or exotic) but everything that we tried was spot-on when it came to portion, presentation, cooking level,  taste, and texture.
We started with the ‘Caramelized Red Onion & Goat Cheese Tartlet’, and the ‘Pan-Fried scallops’. Both dishes were perfect in terms of taste, structure, and presentation. Every element of each dish was discernable and the overall blend was perfect.
We then sampled the ‘Homemade Ravioli’ and the ‘Jumbo Prawns in Kataifi’ for the main courses. At first bite, I felt that the ravioli was a bit salty but it was simply the combination of the Feta and the Parmesan... the palate and the overall finish proved that the dish was performing as intended. The prawns were absolutely phenomenal in every respect and the accompaniment of Saffron Risotto, and small veggies, enhanced by a hint of fennel was absolutely spot-on.
Desert was a ‘Brioche Bread & Butter Pudding’ with pours of warm chocolate and cream at the table. It was delicious.

The wine menu is not extensive but it offers a lot of excellent options at very reasonable prices. We started with a couple of glasses of Crémant de Bourgogne, and then opted for a nice Poully-Fuissé for the meal. The selections worked very well with everything that we had ordered, however as a recommendation to the Owner & to the Chef, it would be worth considering adding a few half-bottles to the wine menu so that patrons would have even more flexibility (say when one person orders a fish dish and the other a meat dish)

Service was impeccable in every respect; the Owner (Susie) was working the room and she was attentive with every table. Our waiter was absolutely super-professional, attentive, and very friendly.

The pudding was particularly good in an evening of excellence. I should also mention the graceful and gracious service. Because the restaurant is small, a deposit is expected for reservations.

Had two drinks each and I was rather surprised at the bill - slugged Euro 5.00 for a 300ml glass of Texels (typically about Euro...3.50 to max 4.00) and then almost Euro 3.00 for a 200ml or 250ml glass of very ordinary local pilsener (I didn't know they served glasses that small in NL). I finally saw red when I was short-changed Euro 2.00 which, when I quietly pointed it out, was rectified by the staff member with an apology - maybe an honest mistake. The bearded owner (or manager) was not interested in the slightest, apart from wanting us to move on, presumably in case his dining customers overheard).

This is a real gem of Dutch cuisine, and we very much enjoyed our meal. The staff were friendly, courteous and professional. They knew the menu really well. 

We got a couple of cold ciders, that were wonderfully tasty; cold and sweet. We started with Dutch Goat Cheese Croquettes; there were three of them, the taste was not overpoweringly of goat, pretty mild and tasty, served over arugula leaves with honey/mustardy pleasant sauce. Very good.

We also ordered a Cheese Fondue. I realize that it was originally a Swiss dish, but Dutch fondue is supposedly prepared with a milder cheese, such as gouda, with mustard or cayenne. Regardless, it was delicious; the bread and the veggies accompanying the cheese were fresh and crisp. We enjoyed it very much. We got one of their present menus, Menu 2, where the main course was baked dish of ground beef, cauliflower and mashed potatoes; basically, it was a shepherd’s pie. It was delicious. For the final main course, we tried the Dutch Steak; it was well prepared slice of meat, not a filet, but since it was medium rare, it was tender and juicy. Menu 2 included little Dutch pancakes covered in powdered sugar; wonderful dessert. In addition, we got Dutch rum raisin variation on the old time favorite; raisins soaked in rum over the vanilla ice cream; it was the bomb!!! Loved it!

Enjoyed it again yesterday at Restaurant Senses!
Knowing that last summer a large part of the white- and black brigade had opted for a different challenge, we didn't really know what to expect.

Hans is a great host and very knowledgable about food and wines. The cook is a master chef who produced a visually beautiful and amazingly tasty meal.

They are very responsive to aspects of allergies, such as shell fish and corn, but are not able to accommodate gluten-free (which was not an issue for us). Even if you have a preference to white wines over red (or vice-versa), Hans always finds the perfect paring for the dish. The ingredients are often very local, including an amazing sauce for one dish that was made from grapes grown right on site. We watched Hans prepare Irish coffees for another table with great presentation and results, while I sipped a wonderful armagnac and nibbled a selection of sweets prepared by the cook. We were referred to the restaurant by a friend and the entire experience did not disappoint. Most definitely looking forward to returning.

This...was my fourth or fifth visit over the years (thought the previous one was quite long ago,  I mustn't wait so long before my next one !)   The chef has changed, the formula has been tweaked a little, but the intimate atmosphere (only 10 tables plus a new Spanish dog) and the delicious food quality with excellent presentation hasn't.  Portions right for a comfortable six courses.  No written menu but plenty of information on the food and wine (and a great welcome) from Hans. There isn't much concession to vegetarianism here - we had two fish based dishes, three meat, one dessert.  The wines in the 'excellent' pairing really were superb - an outstanding mineral Austrian Riesling, a rare Puilly-Fuisse, a good Langhe Nebbiolo,  a top notch 2018 Brunello, a valpolicella amabile and an intriguing 1983 PX. 

You don't rush things here - it'll be three or four hours from start to finish.   If six glasses of wine are too much there's a 'Bob' option (less wine in your glass, just don't expect it to produce a literally ""Bewust Onbeschonken Bestuurder""!). We paid €180 pp. 

* I've criticised several restaurants in Tripadvisor reviews in the past for only offering very mediocre pairing wines with their excellent food.More","Date of visit: November 2023"

It is a small intimate space and I was excited to get a last minute table through my hotel...given the online reviews. From the moment the dinner started things felt chaotic. The owner spent the evening running around doing everything, from seating tables to taking orders. One table was disappointed that they weren't given a different table and the owner angrily informed them that he was too busy to take calls and specific requests because he does everything from clean the toilets to ordering the wine. This attitude remained for the entire meal
The biggest issue with the dinner was that it took 45minutes between the first and second course. I understand things happen in the kitchen but he did not communicate anything with the tables, offer more wine (or even water), or really do anything to let us know what was going on. Many tables became agitated. I was concerned that every course would take this long. When I asked if there was an issue the owner became very irate with me. He told me his never had anyone complain and I needed to be patient. I didn't realize being yelled at was on the menu. I sat down at 530 and asked if I would be able to be done by 830. I thought it was reasonable to assume a 5 course dinner would not take more than 3 hours. He then came BACK to my table to yell at me again. He told me I should be thankful I was given a spot and in his 25 years no-one has ever complained. Well, in my 10+ years of eating at Michelin Star restaurants I have never been treated so poorly or seen such a disorganized restaurant. If you are going to charge 300 euros per person you can afford an extra staff member to help carry the load. Why is there only one person in the kitchen, one person serving, and one person pouring water? The old adage is ""the customer is always right"", not ""treat the customer like a toddler"". 
In fairness after I was scolded for wondering if every course would have a 45min break the remaining courses did come out at a reasonable pace. If he had just apologized and moved on (instead of the hostility) I would have given this place 3.5 stars out of 5 (the food was meh and the ""super"" wine pairings were incredibly overpriced. 
Honestly, this was the worst experience and I cannot believe I paid 300 euros for such a disappointing experience.  Other tables also complained and I hope they also write a review. This owners needs to attend an anger management seminar and perhaps hire at least ONE more staff person. Given what they charge I think they can afford bothMore","Date of visit: October 2023"

The atmosphere in the restaurant itself isn't really cosy, it's near the water yes, but you can see new big glassy...buildings - it's really not the nicest area of Amsterdam. Our disappointments were also that the service wasn't really great, even nor warm. We had to ask for bread twice after two courses, the others got it in the beginning. The waiters didn't look after if we had something to drink. We had cocktails in the beginning, but it took a lot of time when somebody asked what we would like to drink for the menu. (Maybe we even asked for the wine ourselves, I don't remember this for sure.) And the mojito what I drank wasn't a real mojito, probably the worst mojito ever. My husband's drink was ok though.

The food was well made what I already stated, but maybe it was a bit boring. The dessert was a bit of a mess, simpler dessert would have been better.

All in all, my first Michelin star experience was not that great. And I wouldn't go there again. It wasn't as terrible as this sounds. I just had bigger hopes maybe.More","Date of visit: September 2023"

IF you are a vegetarian, you ABSOLUTELY MUST dine here.  Period.  Drop the mic.  Just make the reservation.  Period.

We dined here one week ago today.  The location is perfect,...overlooking the harbor and Amsterdam Centraal Train Station.  We took the subway into the station and then walked over to the restaurant, strolling along the waterfront.  Perfect.  If you are a cruise ship passenger, this is a great location for you (to walk over or a very quick Uber ride over from the cruise ship docks).

We will regularly dine here whenever we are in Amsterdam.

I don't eat meat, so my wife and I selected the multi-course vegetarian tasting menu.  I DON'T want to oversell my opinion, and tastes are quite subjective...but for ME this was the best vegetarian meal i have ever experienced.  Why?  Because I gravitate to complex tastes and spice.  This meal offered this up in spades.  Every course offered was a delight.  The wines by the glass were perfect.  The decaf cappuccino was perfect.  The service was attentive.  

Honestly?  For my tastes?  This restaurant deserves its second Michelin star.  Yes.  For me the complexity and quality of the food offerings were that good.More","Date of visit: May 2023"

We chose the 6-course menu, which was a delightful surprise with each dish creatively and meticulously prepared to perfection. The flavors of the ingredients blended harmoniously and left our taste buds tingling. The Dutch asparagus with kohlrabi, cockles, razor clams, and an airy fenugreek hollandaise was absolutely amazing.

20:00 Inger ×2 the meal was fabulous.

The only other Card we had with us was a prepaid card which was also declined!!.
This went on for around an hour trying to resolve the situation.
I have spoken with my Bank this morning saying that your card system is not secure enough, hence it was declined by our Uk bank. The situation was resolved by your female employee using the secure system you used to take the €60 earlier in the year!!
It has left a bad taste in our month as it was your system that caused this problem and left us missing our last tram back to the Hotel walking for over 50minutes! Felt like criminals trying it on 🫣

From the start it seemed off. The server never asked if we had been there before, if we knew the concept, or even if any had any allergies or anything they could...not eat. A standard at any restaurant of any quality in today's world. We had to ask her how it worked and explained the dietary restrictions of one of our guests. We then ordered a bottle of Sancerre and it was served room temperature. Really unacceptable for a restaurant of this standard. We had to ask her to chill it. We have eaten at other Michelin Guide Restaurants and expected a certain level of service. We then began to notice other diners around us having different wines with each course. We asked our server about wine pairings with each course and she said yes they had it but it was really a lot of wine and most people walked out swaying. Again, we should have been offered the choice and not had to ask about it. We had ordered a bottle of white and red and at no time, did our server offer the wine pairing option. Food was good but really, really small portions even for a Michelin Guide restaurant. When the dessert course was offered, the server said we could have cheese instead of dessert. We asked what dessert was and she said it was a surprise. So we decided to order 2 cheese and 2 desserts. When the bill arrived, we were charged additionally for the cheese course. When we questioned the charge with the male server, he became aggressive and said yes that was correct.  We pointed out that it is not how it was presented to us.  He then agreed to take the charge off the bill and slammed his chair under the table.  Really, really poor attitude.

So good I booked again for the next evening. 
Had a different cut of steak this time but still to share and in my opinion it surpassed the previous evening in taste. Maybe one of the tastiest steaks I have had.

When I questioned the dish, our server said it was what I ordered. Owner came over and actually told me I was correct and asked if I wanted something else.

We went to TripAdvisor and searched for the best restaurants in Venice. The Impronta was in top 5 restaurants in Venice and my wife and I decided to give it a try. We went on Friday and they...were fully booked, so we asked them for a reservation for the next day. The expectations were high and we were not disappointed. The service and food were 5+++ stars. As soon as we entered the restaurant someone greeted us and asked for our jackets to be hung. We were given the menu and we decided to go with the chef mix and the seafood mix for appetizers. For the main course we had the lobster pasta and the black pasta with seafood. 
Food was absolutely amazing, the seafood was fresh and tasty. The tuna tartar and the swordfish was melting in the mouth. Both appetizers were delicious, a true Venetian style appetizer. The pasta was delicious as well and we could tell that pasta was real home made pasta and not the one bought in stores. We were very happy with the service and food.

The service is excellent. Roman and Raisa are the warmest hosts we have ever seen. They have a rich digestive wine and digestive list . Don’t forget to ask Roman for an advise on wine and digestives. 
The downside is once you start going there, you can never eat somewhere else in Venice. On our each trip to Venice we ate every night there.Congratulations Roman and RaisaMore","Date of visit: November 2023"

The prawn appetiser arrived promptly and was good, however we then waited nearly...an hour for our pasta dishes to arrive by which point we were so irritated that they’d never have tasted very good anyway. They were ok but nothing to write home about (we had the gnocchi and ravioli) and both had bits of shell in them. 
We were then going to cancel our second courses however they arrived immediately and were wholly underwhelming. 
The saving grace was the 20% off the bill which came with booking online otherwise we would have certainly been asking for discount. 
It may be ok to come here for a wine and snacks but not dinner. Service was also questionable. Really disappointing and it makes it really hard to trust TripAdviser reviews as our expectations of restaurants are clearly different to others using this platform.More","Date of visit: December 2023"

Then (on a Monday night) they had a live band. Nothing bad to say other than I should have looked at their menu in advance.More","Date of visit: April 2023"

While the restaurant itself boasts a charming ambiance and a menu filled with culinary masterpieces, it was Elisa’s exceptional service that truly made our evening memorable....Her extensive knowledge of the menu and her genuine enthusiasm for the cuisine shone through in every interaction. She was more than a waiter; she was a culinary guide, taking the time to understand our preferences and daring us to try dishes we wouldn’t have ordinarily chosen. Her recommendations were impeccable, each dish a delightful surprise that tantalized our taste buds in ways we hadn’t imagined.

We were seated for an early lunch and were among the first in the restaurant. We ordered quickly: 2 pizzas, one fanta, and one glass of prosecco. We were asked if we wanted water and said...yes please, just tap is fine. The waiter told me they only had bottled water, which I thought was weird as I know Venice tap water is safe to drink. I told them not to worry and we wouldn't have any water. Within the next 5 minutes lots of groups of men came in to be seated. They were all automatically given baskets of bread and carafs of tap water. I was confused because I had just been told that they didn’t do tap water. I called a waiter over and said that actually we would have some water please. They brought over a 500ml plastic bottle of water. I asked if we could have carafe water please - as I pointed to all the other tables. They said ""sorry, but that water is only for local client"". I was so shocked I didn't know what to say. Even if you have a money grabbing policy whereby you don't offer tourists tap water in the first instance, you could at least have some respect and give it to them on request. It is insulting and embarrassing to admit that it's not for local clients, especially when tourists are buying other drinks, including alcohol.

All the other tables then got their food before us, despite coming in much after us. We were left right until the end and the pizza wasn't even nice and certainly not authentic. The restaurant was full of groups of local men and we just felt uncomfortable and observed. The whole experience was deeply disappointing, especially as they have 5* Trip Advisor signs in their window. We didn't even want to stay and finish our food as we just felt so unwelcome the whole time. This was the worst restaurant experience I've ever had.

My husband and I are looking forward to tasting pizza in Italy.  We'll...see how it measures up to pizza back home which we love.  

Santa Croce area.  Easy to find.  Short walk from the vaporetto stop San Toma.  There is inside and outside seating available.  We chose to eat inside.  Seated at a lovely table.  Observed a mix of what appeared to be locals as well as tourists dining here.  

I wish I had made note of our server's name.  He was so friendly and provided excellent service.  Started with drinks.  My first aperol spritz and a beer for my husband.  Not bad.  Bread basket.  The menu is quite extensive but we're here for pizza.  At first I think the price on the menu is by slice but it's for the whole pizza.  On trips we always order the margherita pizza as we're not sure if the pepperoni is going to be like what we have back home.  We tried it on one trip and it was not like the pepperoni we're used to.  Better safe than sorry.  We also decide to order an appetizer which is mostly for my husband.  He picks the moscardini which is octopus, potatoes, cherry tomatoes, and rocket salad.  I tried it it.  Not a fan to be honest but my husband said it was delicious.  

Pleasantly surprised.  The pizza was thin style which we prefer.  Crust was perfect.  Just the right balance of sauce and cheese.  It was very good.  It was almost as good as the pizza we get back home but then the pizza back home is what we're used to.  We have decided to try pizza in each of our destinations of Venice, Florence, Amalfi, and Rome.  So far so good!

Complimentary limoncello shots for a lovely ending to our dinner.  Cost 37.50€/$40.59.  Great food and great service.  Would return.More","Date of visit: August 2023"

Made our reservation for 6:00 pm.  I know that's early by Italian standards for dinner but we were going to a concert tonight that started at 9:00 pm.  

This is a lovely place in the San Polo area.  There...are tables inside and outside.  We prefer to eat inside.  When we arrived we were taken upstairs to the second level and seated at a nice table.  Less noisy upstairs so that suited us just fine.  Not too busy but busier than I thought it would be at this early time.

Our server was fantastic.  I need to really get the names of our servers in the restaurants.  Sometimes it's easy if they have a name tag but if not I just feel awkward asking for his/her name.  Back home the name of the server is printed out on the receipt.  

Menu had a good selection.  First order of business was drinks.  Peroni beer for Richard.  This brand of beer would turn out to be his favorite while we were in Italy.  I go with a glass of the house wine-white.  It's refreshingly good.  The inevitable bread basket.  Richard gets ravioli stuffed with seabass along with pine nuts, botargo, and cherry tomatoes.  Richard said his dish was almost like a soup but was very tasty.  I was thinking that I wanted meat so I chose the beef filet with green pepper.  When asked I opted for the beef to be cooked medium.  We also ordered a side mixed salad to share.  My beef was melt in your mouth tender and perfectly cooked with a nice char to it.  The green pepper was the sauce on the side.  It was delicious!  My husband had a taste of my beef and said it was excellent.  It was so good.  It came with potatoes.  Complimentary limoncello shots ended our meal.  Cost 79.50€/$87.04.  

Back to the vaporetto stop to head to our concert.  We really enjoyed dinner and would definitely return.More","Date of visit: August 2023"

The bar is in the left had corner of St. Marks square when facing the cathedral and...is small and has a minimal number of places to sit. The place was busy, firstly because it is in St. Marks and secondly because it is the meeting place for fans of Venezia football club before home games (and after) and there was a game that evening. The result was that the clientele were an interesting mixture of locals and tourists. Despite the relaxed vibe among the staff service was really professional and the price of the drinks very good given the location.

At the risk of not getting a table the next time we visit, this longstanding establishment - and favorite of locals and tourists alike...- is truly a special dining experience we wholeheartedly recommend.

The building is over 500 years old, the restaurant a mere 150 years or so (according to our waiter). The charming interior is an interesting mix of rustic brick columns and walls, which display art in varying forms along with the much appreciated in August, air conditioning units.

Hard to say enough about the scrumptious meal we enjoyed. From the appetizers - cheese platter, carpaccio, scallops -  to the main courses - various pastas and meats - to the creme brulee toasted tableside -  it was all amazing.

Clearly a family endeavor finely honed over long experience, the care and appreciation for their customers was evident from the time we entered the restaurant. The waitstaff was outstanding, the meal exceptional. We would definitely return.More","Date of visit: August 2023"

The food was overpriced for the quality and the ambience was not impressive. But what made the experience memorable was the waiter. The server/owner? was really pushy, which made us very much uncomfortable.
We were recommended a dish...and foolishly didnt inquire about the price before we were served. Big mistake, it was the most expensive meal we ended up having on the whole trip, (And we werent in Italy to save on the dining experiences) but most certainly not the best. It was a bland experience.
The waiter is not your friend, its all about the upsell. 
On top of that, he kept on raving about how they have the best tiramisu in all of Italy. In truth, it was a bit of a mess, and we were'nt impressed.
Instead of letting us enjoy what could have been a romantic evening in peace, the server relentlessly kept on pushing us to review the restaurant online. Almost felt like he expected us to do it right then and there, while he watched over our shoulder. Which could explain the many good reviews on this webside.

We took a vaporetto from our hotel near Rialto all the way to Giardini della Biennale.  We probably should have got off the vaporetto at the S....Elena stop.  As it was it took us a bit to find this small restaurant.  We had dinner here on 8/30/2023.

Our reservation was for 7:00 pm and we just made it with minutes to spare as we got a little lost!  There is seating outside and inside.  We prefer to dine inside.

This is a family run quiet, casual place.  Very relaxed vibe.  Service was spot on.  Menu is small but varied.  Lots of appealing items.  

But I've read some reviews and I know what I want.  Drinks-house white wine for me, beer for him.  I order the spaghetti alla busara.  This is spaghetti sautéed with prawns in a spicy ""busara"" sauce.  The sauce is tomatoes, garlic, and chili pepper.  It's not as spicy as I thought it would be. The pasta is perfectly al dente.  Delicious.  My husband got the gnocchi da mare which is small gnocchi served in a stew of ""Mitilla"" mussels, clams, and prawns.  He loved his choice.  Great food.  Great service. Cost 42.50€/$46.30.  

As we walked back through the quiet night to the vaporetto stop we paused for a bit to sit on a bench and just chill.  Would definitely return even though the place is a distance from our hotel.  Well worth the journey to get here.More","Date of visit: August 2023"

I ordered gnocchi with mussels, Spaghetti ""busara"" and Mixed Fried Fish; every dish was executed and presented with what I...perceived as the highest precision and intentionality, not only from the perspective of technique in the kitchen but also from outside of the kitchen, from sourcing the very best ingredient there is. Among all the dishes I have sampled, the most creative one has to be the Panna Cotta. As many people already know, Panna Cotta is essentially a sweetened cream which later congeals into a custard-like texture. While the Panna Cotta can be favoured with anything that you can think of, rarely have I tried any other favour besides rum, coffee, or vanilla. In Pampo, the chef behind the kitchen option to use thyme to favour the cream to give the Panna Cotta an earthy twist and savoury aftertaste, a must-try for those like me who are less enthusiastic but still intrigued by the art of dessert-making.More","Date of visit: October 2023"

What's not to like? The mature woman and man who served us could not have been...nicer. Each course was a treat. Cost per person for lunch, including a bottle of wine between two, came to about 65 euros per head (Venice is not cheap). Getting to Torcello takes time. Being Sunday, good weather and Italy's Mothers' Day no doubt added to the throng going out to the islands of Murano, Burano and Torcello (the first two are on the way) and the Vaporetto boats were very busy. Making the necessary change of Vaporetto at Burano on the way back, we had to queue in the sun for nearly half an hour because the first boat back to Venice could not take everyone. So allow a lot of time each way, and add ninety minutes at least if you wish to walk around part of Murano or Burano island en route. Also leave up to an hour if possible to visit the extraordinary, ancient basilica on the island, a short walk beyond this restaurant, with its large mosaic of the Virgin and Child -- and its  fresco of the Day of Judgment which helps to keep one's good fortune at being able to dine in a place like this in perspective.More","Date of visit: May 2022"

We discovered this amazing restaurant by accident on our first trip stopping by for lunch on a whim and have returned at every opportunity. The...location is fabulous being surrounded by beautifully manicured gardens at about the halfway point between the vaporetto dock and the Church of Maria Assunta. It is amazing to find such a high class (yet not ostentatious or stuffy) restaurant on such a sparsely-inhabited island. The staff are all super-attentive without being overbearing and the service is just wonderful - knowledgeable without being pretentious, friendly without being obsequious. It really is a perfect mix of classy and welcoming. You know you’re in for a treat from the very start as the bread basket is a meal in itself - at least six different varieties were presented to us and it took all our self-control to have some left for the actual meal. I must admit that I’ve lost my notes on what we actually ordered but we had several courses and each was a small portion but absolutely perfect in every way. As you can see from the website they have an eclectic menu and pair proteins with salads, vegetables and other local plant produce in unique flavor and textural combinations. The preparation and presentation was perfect. The peaceful setting and perfect food are an ideal alternative to the hustle and bustle of the touristy areas of Venice.More","Date of visit: September 2019"

I can't remember why so late as most of our previous dinners were at 8:00 pm.  Maybe that was the only time I could get?  

I wanted to try this restaurant which is part of...the Hotel Saturnia.  The hotel had been one of our choices for our stay in Venice and since we ended up not staying there I wanted to at least check out the restaurant and see the hotel. Had  to walk  a little from the vaporetto stop of San Marco Vallaresso.  We passed lots of high end stores like Prada.  

We were seated in an open air garden type setting.  Very nice.  Drinks-Birra Venezia for my husband and a spritz for myself.  Wish I had made a note of what kind of spritz it was.  I just remember it tasted great and had a red hue to it.  Think it might have been select spritz.  Whatever, it was delicious and I loved it.  The bread basket had a nice variety of bread.  My husband ordered the fish soup, Caravella style.  He was able to soak the bread in the broth of the fish soup which he said was so tasty.  He was happy with his choice.    I got the homemade ravioli stuffed with veal and  veggies in a parmesan cream.  It was terrific.  Presentation was wonderful.  Everything was perfect.  The dessert menu intrigued us with items we've never had before.  I got mille-feuille with lemon cream and strawberries.  Sounded so good.  My husband got semifreddo with heart of chocolate, rum, and honey from the island of Sant'Erasmo.  OMG!   Dessert was all that and more.  Complimentary chocolate cookies-at least I think they were cookies but whatever they were they were tasty-were a delightful way to tend our dinner.  Service was excellent.  Attentive but not obtrusive.  Very willing to explain items on the menu.  Friendly.  Cost 120€/$130.61. 

Would most definitely return.  Nice slow walk back to the vaporetto stop  A lovely evening.More","Date of visit: September 2023"

The adjoining hotel has a lot of history as we read a hand written letter from Ray Charles thanking them for their service during his stay in the 80’s.

Boringly we both had it on both visits last month. If you are lucky enough to go in winter the Amaretto souffle will be on the menu, do not miss it.

The staff are quite superb and their ability to read guests is unparalleled in our experience. If you wish nothing more than a professional  service, with no interaction apart from explaining the dishes and serving, you can have it.

The one thing in particular is the attention to detail, from front of house to the kitchen, two teams working as one, and a menu that will certainly leave you wanting for more. I have lost count of the times my wife and I have dined in this restaurant, and lost count of the tears that fall when we leave, seriously, even if you are not celebrating anything in particular, they find a way to celebrate your visit, it’s relaxed it is a room that offers superb comfort and in a style that makes you feel very special. The dishes change often, the kitchen has incredible imagination, the culinary skills invite you and take you to another level of food heaven, served on a plate that’s almost a work of art, is a work of art, and served and delivered with a smile, a master class of culinary magic, and for me and my wife, to be there is something we look forward to no matter how many times we visit Venice.

The food was good, no question. And while on the pricey side, the prices were not unreasonable. This is downtown Prague after all. But, yes, the PRICE RANGE CZK 219 - CZK 328 given on Tripadvisor is just not correct. It's more like double that.

From the moment I walked in a smile beamed across the room with cordiality. 

On the slightly quieter side of IP...Pavlova it's a pity this place, at the time of writing, doesn't get the attention it deserves. In fact I can truly say it was the best burger I've ever tasted in my eight years of living in Czechia. Balanced, juicy — cooked to one's liking — and yet still surprisingly light and filling are just some words that sum up their burgers. I am stumped to fault this place in terms of service, ambiance and quality. 

In terms of decor the place exudes charm, thought and style. It has a certain American diner feel with a twist of sumptuousness and comfort thrown in. 

I particularly appreciated their Bernard beer on tap too, a certain favourite of mine, among their home made BBQ dip and scrumptious fries. There is nothing innovative or experimental about this place which is what I respected. Simply put it embodies all that one should envisage when wanting a damn good traditional burger n' fries.

What a wonderful find!
 Lovely helpful service, wine which was recommended, and food freshly prepared at the counter.
You can order just a few dishes and then more if you are...still hungry but we found the portions to be very reasonable. Everything was delicious. 
 It’s was our favourite meal of our break and will definitely be back if we visit again. In fact we may book a trip just to visit here again.

We have been to a few different ""Irish Pubs"" in Prague, but none like the Three Fiddles.

Joe (the owner) and Eddie (the Manager), as well as the...rest of the team working there give you a very warm Irish welcome.

After that, we were treated to some great pints of Guinness and glasses of wine and some very tasty food (Irish curry half and half, and fish and chips).

We also had mozzarella sticks, which may be the best I have had.

Finally, it was a Sunday evening and we were treated to some traditional live Irish music from Declan.

Staff weren’t friendly. 

Restaurant was empty when we arrived. 

Starters ok, tasty & hot but all came out at different times. 

Mains : again all came out at different times and got our order wrong  and were...all tasteless. Rice was cold. My friend asked for some curry sauce to go with their sizzling dish and they couldn’t accommodate.  

All in all maybe the worst curry I’ve ever had.

On a mission to experience Czech cuisine at every meal.  Prague city transport is so well-integrated that almost any district is easy to reach.  We thought for a moment Vysočanská looked far from our hotel (on the map), but it...took us less than 15 mins, because the metro is so convenient.  Book ahead to avoid disappointment!

Restaurace Pepř a Sůl offers modern Czech cuisine in a smart-but-still-relaxed environment.  The team clearly love their menu and ingredients, and are keen to share their knowledge and ensure their guests enjoy the experience.  Our waiter was brilliant at guiding us through the menu, and made enthusiastic recommendations which we were only too happy to follow.  A soup starter:  I had light but creamy cabbage with ham, and my friend had a clear beef broth.  For our main course, I had a lamb shank served with spinach and a Czech relative of dauphinoise potatoes, and (of course, this is Czechia) served in an ocean of delicious thick sauce.  My friend had rabbit with julienne vegetables (and a rich mustard cream sauce). We were also treated to a delicious amuse-bouche served with the freshest bread.  Czech restaurant portions are generous indeed, so it was with some effort we also had pudding - I chose the rhubarb and strawberries because I love rhubarb and was interested to see how it was served.  Very sweet with ice cream and cream!  After all that, we relaxed with a glass of hruškovice as a digestif.  We loved this place very much.  I wish we could go back (I hope we will one day).  For now, we leave it to you guys to follow in our footsteps.More","Date of visit: June 2023"

The staff are very friendly to chat with the customers and are always on hand to assist.

If you have children...they cater for all tastes.  I have 4yr & 2yr old and they have dishes on the menu that are not overly too spicy hot & it's definitely the best restaurant for them, as they would say. During the summer months the backyard terrace is open and they have play area and large trampoline. Works out perfect when your children get bored the parents can sit, relax in peace and enjoy the great food.

Though you need to travel to outskirts of Prague, it's worth it.  You can catch the train back to center of Prague within 10min. 

The area of location Dolne Pocernice is a beautiful looking Czech village (Prague) with a park and lake with very nice scenery. As well as a brewery in the area.

Don't miss out and visit if you love Indian food.More","Date of visit: May 2022"

Received an email very quickly when I sent a booking request. Arrived and after a little confusion likely caused by our scottish accents we were shown to our table. The restaurant itself is small but very quaint...and had a lovely atmosphere. 
Staff were friendly and not over attentive allowing us to enjoy our meals while being there should we need anything. They did check if everything was okay.
Food was beautiful we ordered lasagne, raviolli and a couple of pizzas. Kids demolished the pizza and i managed to steal a slice and it was extemely good, not to much sauce and the crust was light. Pasta was fresh and all in all just great food.
A little outside the centre although it was near our hotel but I would recommend it. Not a tourist trap like some you see reviewed and the prices were very reasonable. There is a 40 CZK cover per person, its on the menu you cannot miss it so I dont see what the fuss is in previous reviews.

They offer a 5 course diner (besides a excellent a la carte menu) with accompanied wines. Only problem is that I'm allergic to cream, so we mentioned...this with our reservation. 
After a pleasantly warm welcome the owner immediately came up to us and asked about the aforemetioned cream issue; he then went to great lengths to find several options so I could still have a 5 course diner. With accompanied wines wich he had to improvise as well. (my wife had the 'regular' 5 courses and other wines to accompany them)
What followed was the perfect birthday dinner; very nice dishes (proudly made with a lot of local produce) accompanied with some excellent Czech wines in a really relaxing atmosphere. Very good service, no rushing, and some interesting talks about the wines and more ;)  
To Czech standards this might be on the more expensive end of restaurants, but compared to the high quality dishes and wines it is very reasonably priced compared to Belgian restaurants of the same calibre.
So, once again; big thanks to both the owner and the waitress for the excellent service and of course to the chef for his fine dishes !
Highly recommended !

We were so excited to come and have pizza here after reading the amazing reviews. We realised that we arrived on the night they had reopened in their new premises....First of all we were left waiting at the door for 10 minutes without being greeted or even being acknowledged. 

When we were finally seated, we were not approached for our order and had to find a waitress ourselves. After placing our order we were waiting around another 10 minutes just for our drink. 

The restaurant at this point was only half full, will many empty tables. What we did notice as time was passing was that there seemed to be a number of tables waiting for their food. We noticed a woman go to complain with regards to where their food was. At this point we had been waiting almost an hour and these people who were seated long before us still did not have their food. It was now 10pm and with no sign of anything. we again tried to speak to a waitress to enquire. We were told that the restaurant was busy so it will be a while. 

Me and my partner agreed that we were too tired to wait now. With no indication of when we would received our pizza we asked to just pay for our drinks. Our reservation was at 9pm and we left the restaurant around 10.15pm still having had no food.

The waitress who took our payment for 2 beers only said to us that the restaurant was full and she was sorry. There was no sincere apology, no offer of free drinks or offer to return one night in order to provide better service. 

We were extremely disappointed as this was out last night in Prague and wanted to enjoy our last evening. Instead we ended up going to Burger King to eat. I am a fairly laid back person and understand that problems do arise. We were patient and would have perhaps waited a little longer if the customer service had been better and the staff had sincerely apologised or offered something for us to stay.More","Date of visit: September 2023"

My wife and I had just completed a tour of the Cold War bunker next door (also very good!) to this place and wanted somewhere relaxing for a nice, not too heavy lunch. We couldn’t have found anywhere better...We went for a selection of sushi dishes, including a “roll your own eel sushi”, and a bottle of champagne. All the sushi was really excellent, but the best was the eel. It was light, fresh and tasty and presented very well

We were also very fortunate to be attended by Raul. He provided an excellent attentive and friendly service as well as being able to advise

We enjoyed the food and atmosphere so much that we ordered a repeat of the food to have round two and soak up the excellent atmosphere with what remained of our champagne

We sat outside, but in the shade, on a beautiful sunny day, soaking up the atmosphere

Had to wait for ages for drinks, no wine cooler for our white wine (had to ask 3 times) then our food was over an hour late to arrive.  One of the starters was inedible, asked to change so a replacement starter was brought over but 3 of us had already finished eating so really not ideal but “we won’t charge you”although they did!)  Food was far from great - overcooked salmon for one!  Beware the photos on the website don’t look at all like the type of food you will receive!!  The website and how the food was presented on there was what drew us to book there!  We asked for more water which again took an age to arrive.  Then they charge you for water you didn’t even have even though you ask for tap water (apparently they have to charge in the Czech Republic even though no other restaurants did while we were there!!)

It was presented in a traditional Cuban artistic bowl which was a nice touch. It was very strong but the taste so much better then standard mojito.

It is totally charming and the Host and Chef, and their staff are incredibly gracious.  The dishes are very creative and very beautiful.

I can't describe all of the food but I will high light some of it:
- It's fall, think pumpkin. Perfect dish for a cool night.
- Sturgeon soup - almost indescribably delicious.
- A gnochi like dish with mushrooms, pickeled mushrooms and egg? foam.
-Beef cheek (photo) paired with a Hungarian Temprranillo (melt in your mouth)
- Plus more and dessert.
- After dinner drinks (I had Palinka)

We did the Hungarian wine pairings and they were are very good.  They started with a wlecome sparkler that we really liked.  I recommend savoring your arrival with an additional bottle of that for about 5000 HF (US$15)

Service was great, well paced and each course was described in detail.

As our first dinner in Budapest, the benchmark has been set beyond high! It’s a small and intimate restaurant with just 7 tables and no more than 14 diners. Dinner starts for everyone...at 7pm and you settle in for night. Their whole concept is to create a dinner party with friends feel, and boy have they achieved that. Set in an apartment (not obvious from outside) they’ve done a wonderful job at designing the restaurant to feel like home with a cosy and relaxed ambience. A lot of thought and care has gone into the detail. The kitchen is open and you can’t believe that just three people are capable of running this entire experience so slickly while creating such works of art in the tasting menu. They were so attentive with our drinks and checking in to have a chat about the food. It was incredibly personable and friendly. And the time between each course was perfect; relaxed and yet on it all the same. Like a true dinner party setting in your home! Please continue to honour your bookings and support gems like Zincenco who go out their way to offer a culinary experience like no other, with brilliantly sourced fresh produce and a menu that has been well thought through.More","Date of visit: October 2023"

We had 4/5 tapas dishes each, were stuffed by the end and couldn’t finish it all. All the food was delicious and hot and served with a complimentary bread basket. We enjoyed the food too much so didn’t take enough pictures, whoops. The lamb dish was beautiful and the chef was able to accommodate the request for well done lamb chops.

They also charge 13% service even though you need to get your food on your own, the waiters just clean the table between meals.
The prices...are very high for what you get in return. 
You have between 2 to 2 and a half hours to eat and the food takes a long time to arrive even though it's smaller portions so most of the time you have is wasted on that. The kitchen is closed sometime between 10pm to 11pm so you don't get to order more food afterwards as well.
The whole experience felt like a hotel dining room.
This place sells something it can't deliver and a waste of money and time. 
I'd advise you not to come and go eat somewhere else, but if you do decide to come don't choose the ""All you can eat"" option.More","Date of visit: December 2023"

The second time I came by I was offered one of two tables and that had to be free by 4:00 p.m. A couple then came...in and the same waiter said two tables are available (behind me magically they appeared). the waiter seemed a little abrupt but asks everyone coming in where they are from. there's one small toilet that is for both men and women. The bar has champagne bottles circled around the eves. Behind the bar are four chefs frantically cooking away. I started with a cappuccino but then couldn't get a liqueor shot added  like Cointreau? then ordered tomato soup which was more like a thick tomato paste Prego sauce, after that I ordered pork medallions (six medallions) which was good although the glaze had no measurable taste with mashed potatoes (boring), and a side of green pepper sauce. Then was offered compris a little dessert wine and  then a refreshing sherbet, and a schnapps. Nice touch. But when I charged out the waiter automatically added 15percent tip not nice.

The restaurant was full when we were there and my family of 8 had to wait outside. It didn't take very long for the staff to notice us and she...came to inform us very politely that we will have to wait for 10 minutes or more and may have to split up. We were fine with this knowing how difficult it is for restaurants to accomodate such a big group. We didnt have to wait long and the staff together with the owner came to welcome us after arranging the tables for our group. All this while, i felt their welcome and their service attitude to be very warm, genuine and very friendly. After making our orders, the staff came to laid the utensils and plates for us to get ready for the food. We had ordered 7 mains and 6 drinks as we are sharing the food and drinks within our group of 6 adults and 2 kids of aged 12 and 13. But we were given 8 side plates and extra cups. one of my brother informed the boss that he has given us extra cups but the boss replied that the cups are for whoever wants to share the drinks. i think this is really thoughtful as most restaurants do not ever think of this! All the food came and oh my, the burgers are one of the best we have ever tried! The portions are generous, the beef patties are succulent and tasty, the chicken is nicely grilled and flavourful! The buns are awesome that is soft on the inside and slightly crispy on the outside. All this time while having the food, the boss had dropped in at least twice to check on us on the food and everything. He is very friendly and we felt the pride he had in the food he served which we all had agreed!   And how nice is the food? Well, there was never an empty seat throughout the time we were there. I remembered this too, while waiting for a table outside the restaurant at the start, a man came and queued behind us. When our turn came to go in, he said lucky us to be able to have a table. I smiled and wished him luck too. Thankfully, he got a seat soon after we were seated as outside is realy cold like 0 degrees celcius. His order was taken too after us. But his food came first! And i am not complaining this. In fact i am complimenting the restaurant/boss. Instead of letting someone wait for so long after a big group is served, I'd rather have the individual served first. This is another good act from the restaurant who can think for the customers. And to tell you how good is the food, this man who got served first, had 2 burgers and with extra meat as add-ons. One size of the burger is good enough to be shared with probably 1.5 adults! LOL.. By the way while settling the bill, the bill came and had the service charge already added to the bill. i gave an extra 20 euros to tip but she rejected and said the standard service charge has been added and there was no need for me to tip anymore! Now, this is a first in Europe for us. For the service attitude, the quality of food and the thoughfulness from the restaurant, the lady staff and especially the boss, a big thank you! The F&B industry should learn from Lucky 7 indeed!!More","Date of visit: December 2023"

The lady under the care of whom we were – I think Zsofia was her name – is a very pleasant, welcoming and naturally friendly person. The sommelier is a very polite and friendly guy too who obviously is a professional at its business having full knowledge about the offered beverages. We had a champagne chilled for the perfect temperature – the selection of beverages is really remarkable. We definitely recommend this restaurant and we will be definitely back too.

Vibrant in atmosphere, Cocktails and a lengthy list of Wines offered, opening bites are delicate works of art ranging from a gold Sunchoke Chip to bite-size Lángos surrounding layered Parsnip Soup.

Proudly Hungarian but technique-focused, the Bread Basket showing off five styles alongside housemade Butter and Liptauer, one need only look at “Cucumber filled with White Asparagus” to understand the kitchen’s talent as each curl comes carefully filled in a spring-scented pool beneath a dainty Tart.

A slow-build served to accommodate the table’s pace, Peas and sparkling Pine Nuts again seeing Asparagus utilized with expertise, Chef Dalnoki's Foie Gras is a study in taste and texture while his Bocuse-clinching Sterlet Fillet reminisces of something served at Geranium or Jordnær.

Next reinventing tradition with Széll's version of Gulyás, a ubiquitous dish here focused on each Ingredient, Venison concludes savories with smoke and sweetness before a palate cleansing plate of Strawberry Ice with Mint atop White Chocolate.

Certainly worthy of it's 2* from Michelin, a third justifiable based on the strength of this seasonal tasting, Dessert offers a choice from which Somlói achieves unprecedented refinement before concluding with five more sweet bites.More","Date of visit: June 2023"

I cannot fault the service - it was extremely attentive. I was very impressed at how every passing waiter looked at each table to ensure plates were cleared, water or wine...topped up ect. Each dish was personally presented with a description. 
The food was beautifully presented and used stunning ingredients. We had the cosmopolitan tasting menu. However, compared to other fine dining / high calibre restaurants I have been to they were not so refined in flavour and were not well balanced. A far distance from perfection. The beef tartare was not to either of our liking (I usually love this dish but it was creamy and had too many gerkins which unfortunately resulted in the flavour of a McDonald’s quarter pounder). The salmon had everything but the kitchen sink thrown at it and was lost and had a slightly odd flavour as a result  (truffle, pistachio, caviar, horseradish). The veal was perhaps our favourite but there was too much of the mushroom on the plate which was overpowering and on its own didn’t actually taste very nice.

The seafood was some of the best I’ve ever had in my life, and it was also among the cheapest.  The service was also outstanding. Our server was from Greece and spoke flawless English.

We three middle aged guys from London were on an evening out on town with our Hungarian friend. I wanted to show him somewhere he did not know in the area and found this place recommended on TA. 

We arrived at around...8:20 to find a surprisingly empty bar with only one couple but upstairs in the mezzanine level (where the toilets were) were a few more people. There was a musty smell that we eventually put down to the cellar below. We got used to it after a while so no problem.

The friendly barman welcomed us and told us he would serve us at the table. We sat next to the main window on the comfortable sofas to attract more people in (it does work!). The waiter delivered us some drinks lists which were very well priced. We chose a big white wine spritze, a couple of beers and a 'Brave Lion' which I had read about in other reviews although I was not going to try to get listed on the board of those who tried, failed, collapsed or got eaten alive by their endeavour.

The drinks came in good time and the beers were fine.  My Brave Lion was in a large jam pot and was a bit wishy washy so the four spirits/liqueurs it boasted must have been half measures each. Maybe that is what one would expect at that price (£5 ish) but they were not Spanish 'measures'. It was quite tasty though. The barman told us of those who had attempted them in volume and either got hospitalised or worse.... 

Our local friend's 500cl Spritzer was a bit flat and the wine not very good although he chose the second from cheapest (200cl wine : 300cl water). He was not impressed and could not drink it on the end as it was so flat. I drank it instead, although it is not my cup of tea but it was flat.

Our local friend had to leave at 21:15 as he had to get up early for work. We stayed on a few more minutes and settled the bill. By then the bar was filling up at both levels so it obviously has a regular crowd.

I decided to venture downstairs ('Speakeasy' according to the sign) but was advised by the barman that is being refurbished, it looks promising but needs the damp to be sorted! I suggested they put two buttons in the wall, one red and one blue, to press before descending (no consequences whichever way after though!). They could also offer two versions of their Rabbit Hole cocktail in those two colours! The choice is yours! One blue one could be a mocktail! You heard it here first!! I'll be happy with 10% of the profits from those drinks ;-).... 

Toilets upstairs are fine btw! It sounds (from other reviews) like this is a venue for Hen Parties and a 'graffiti/signing board' upstairs has a few more comments about that sort of clientele. The barman was a new employee who did not know the history it seems (some reviews said it moved to these premises around March 2023).

We left reasonably happy to make our way back via Habrolo (which turned out to be too noisy inside and smokey outside) then onto our favourite bar Dzzs instead, then 'home'...More","Date of visit: September 2023"

It’s very simple to make reservations there and I highly recommend it because many people love to go here. Once you arrive you’ll be greeted...and the person seating you will even take your coats for you. 

Food….10/10. This is by far in my Top 3 restaurants that I have had the pleasure to visit. The Caviar Butter was absolutely delicious and the Gyoza was superb for starters. We had the sushi and I can honestly say, the California Roll there was the best California Roll I’ve ever had in my life. 

Drinks, guess what? It’s another 10/10. They actually had the ingredients for a French Martini and that’s hard to find in restaurants. Their signature drink is a must as well, trust me, just get it.

The staff at this restaurant are some of the kindest and most welcoming staff I’ve had at a restaurant. Our waiter, Gergë, was phenomenal, polite, and always around to help us with anything. The General Manger there, Hejassy Florian, was so kind with us and so welcoming here. These two gentlemen really made us want to stay longer and drink all night. They’re amazing guys!

Thank you Yama Budapest for an amazing time!

The drinks are served with flavor and flair, one came with a smoking wood chip and the other with a dry ice fog.  They didn't just look good, they tasted good...too.  On to the food.  The shrimp tempura in spicy sauce, wagyu sliders, and dessert were tasty.  But my favorite dish was the scallop roll with caviar.  Incredible.   All of this with great service and excellent recommendations in a nice atmosphere.  Pricey but worth it.More","Date of visit: December 2023"

Without an exaggeration, possibly one of the few memorable dining experiences I have ever had, anywhere in the world.
I usually divide my reviews...into 3 sections:
1. food: amazing! Of course some dishes were better than the others but all of them were tasty. I personally loved rock shrimp tempura. The presentation of the food is also quite nice. 

Staff and atmosphere: the staff were nice and professional, they knew the menu very well and could offer great recommendations.

The atmosphere is perfect for a romantic setting, rather than a family gathering or a night with friends. Dimly lit lights with neon lights gives it a cozy yet cyberpunk feeling.
 

The prices: the prices were decent since the quality of the food and services was so high.

 
Overall: I will go back there any time I visit Budapest, highly highly recommended. One of the few places in Budapest that really impressed us. We tried some Michelin starred restaurants and they were not much compared to Yama.More","Date of visit: October 2023"
