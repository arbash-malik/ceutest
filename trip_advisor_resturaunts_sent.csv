Otherwise, find Minories and follow Hammett Street around to the right and into the Crescent, then under the railway bridge. Look out for a sign...set high on the wall, as the entrance door is tucked back at an angle and easy to miss.

The cafe is a great space – large yet relaxed and cosy, clean and comfortable. Sid, the owner, is a lovely guy – attentive and happy to chat, but not in the least bit pushy. He clearly takes a lot of pride in his business. (And rightly so!)

The cafe was fairly busy with the tail end of the breakfast crowd, but we were seated and got our menus promptly, and drinks soon arrived while we chose our food. The cappuccino was exceptional – nice strong coffee, and lovely thick foam that lasted to the end. (Like a dessert in a cup – in a good way!) I couldn't manage two, but the tea (builders'-style) I had later was strong and refreshing.

We both had the V3 breakfast with extra black pudding. Good-quality bacon cooked until slightly crisp but not dry, a lovely herby sausage, tasty baked beans, an 'over easy' fried egg, and thick toast. The black pudding had loads of flavour and was perfectly cooked. Last but not least, 'proper' chips – thick-cut, fluffy on the inside and crispy on the outside.

"Kinaara","1 Waterview Drive Greenwich Peninsula, London SE10 0TW England","4","5.0","334","44.0","95.0","My much better half treated me to dinner at Kinaara for my birthday the other day, and I can hardly imagine a more wonderful gift. The food, the place, and the team were (are!) amazing. We loved it.

We were seated at a beautiful corner...table with a view of Canary Wharf and Docklands, with their reflections glistening in the river. The view alone is worth a visit, but when the food appears and we see each others’ smiles at what we are being served, the view is but a pretty little distraction.
 
The amuse-bouche really did amuse (our ‘bouches’, I guess). It supposed to be little teaser, and, oh, does it tease. A delicate, light play on corn, it is both wonderfully subtle and a slap in the face, telling your palate “strap in, hold tight, you’re here for an adventure”.

A few reviews had mentioned the grilled broccoli, and how surprised they were at something so simple being so spectacular. Well, they weren’t wrong. They’re a triumph: hint of smokiness, a hint of spice, just enough crunch, and yet so comfortably smooth and soft and, excuse me, sexy. Outrageous. 

Slap the word tandoori in front of anything, and I’ll be certain to try it. It doesn’t always work, but give a great chef a tandoor, and, hey, presto: Magic. These chefs definitely know what they’re doing. A bit like a good pizza oven, it does a lot of the work, but you still have to put in the effort, and the right ingredients, in the right order. 

The tandoori prawns are as glorious as they look. The missus ;) knew that although we’re sharing all these marvellous dishes, there was no chance I wasn’t going to have most of the prawns. I love good seafood, and this is seafood at its very best. 

Being from Azerbaijan means growing up with a lot of lamb dishes, and usually, as in her case, becoming quite picky and curious about other interpretations of lamb. She chose two lamb dishes. Considering she married me, you’d be entitled to question her choices, but not these. This time, she chose well. 

The dainty chops, the lamb starters, Lamb Barrah, were just lovely. I looked around to make sure I don’t embarrass myself and saw a guest at another table picking up a lamb chop as it should be picked up and gnawing at it. This is not a dish that should be eaten with knife and fork alone. You want to have every last bit of spicy, juicy, crispy yumminess. These little lambs did not sacrifice themselves in vain.

Of course I had to order a biryani. Some of my best friends are Gujarati. Some of the best meals I have ever eaten were biryanis. This one, Dum Pukht Chicken Biryani, the one with the pastry lid, is right up there with the best of them. 

Our other main, the lamb shank, Lamb Nihari, is a joke. It defies physics. How? Just how? How does it stay on the bone just long enough to reach our table and then fall off? How does it stick on the fork and then melt in the mouth like a meaty toffee?

And while I ponder the impossibility or, at the very least, unlikelihood of these dishes, my darling dearest has a taste of the Dal Makhani, dark and creamy lentils from heaven, and gives me a knowing look. This is good, really, really good, she tells me - without saying the words. Thank you for taking me here (with words), and thank Zana for recommending this.

And before it gets too repetitive - it was really was that consistently great - and just after briefly noting that the desserts were sensational too, may I just mention that although I loved it all, my personal culinary highlight, the dish that was most for me and most like me, was the unlikely okra, Masala Bhindi: Humble, but arrogant, subtle and yet brash, with a bit of bite, but also unashamedly a little slippery, not to everyone’s liking, but, well, liked, somehow.

I blame it on my partly Turkish roots. Okra is a delicacy in Turkey and it is also a delicacy by virtue of it being delicate. Even slightly overcooked, it becomes a gloopy mess. Slightly under, and it’s torture, like the sort half-cooked beans English restaurants used to serve. I have had okra many many times. My dad is an okra expert and he makes damn fine okra dishes. We disagree and argue a lot, but on this we agree. This okra, Kinaara’s okra, ‘our’ okra is wonderful. It’s life-affirming. 

Occasionally, I have had people tell me that they don’t like “spicy” food, and I try my very best to be polite, respectful and understanding, but on the inside, in my mind, in the deep recesses of my soul, I pity them. 

I believe that the two great national cuisines, if there is such a thing, are Italian and Indian. Yes, there is good and even great food in all sorts of places, but considering the quality of food I have eaten both in restaurants and in private homes, the pride in the ingredients and the preparation, these two cuisines are quite clearly exceptional. I have travelled a bit and eaten a lot (plus I’m ridiculously old) and with my family from or in four continents, I know that is quite a generalisation, but I know it’s true.

I had a great aunt, god rest her soul, my nan’s brother’s wife, who was from Bangalore, and who introduced me to her cuisine when I was just a toddler, and, yes, it was by far the best food I had as a child - or since. She lived in Germany for most of her adult life, and whenever we visited I would spend hours with her in the kitchen, as she cooked and cursed the lack of proper food or ingredients in the shops, or laughed and sneered at what Germans and other Europeans called “curry”.

And, yes, the use of spices in Indian food is very pronounced. But to describe Indian cuisine simply as spicy, or even ‘too spicy’, is ridiculous. What great Indian food demonstrates is that spices are ingredients among many others, elements within a dish, prepared with attention to detail, with intricate timing, using all the various traditional and modern techniques and tools to create something delicious and nutritious. Not liking food because it is spicy, is no less silly than not liking food that is marinated, food that is properly cooked, made in stages rather than just thrown together randomly, or, frankly, food with any discernible taste.

The food at Kinaara is just that: bursting with taste, made with great care, with discernment and discipline, with deft, delicate touches, with experience and expression, prepared, presented and served by excellent, thoroughly pleasant professionals. 

We were served, expertly, by Varun, and welcomed by Diveena and Soniya, and both Zana, the fabulously charming restaurant manager, and Mohan, who manages all the restaurants and bars at the hotel with a lovely blend of pride and humility, came to greet us, all of whom made it a memorable experience for which we are truly grateful.

London has many options, but if one is anywhere near the O2, skip the venues near the arena and visit Kinaara on floor two of the intercontinental hotel. The restaurant has two glass walls overlooking the Thames, the...prime meridian (marked at night with a green laser) and part of the  London skyline. The views are spectacular. The restaurant  is even better. 

Kinaara is exceptional. It is very welcoming and the staff are outstanding, and the food is delicious. I have eaten in many Indian restaurants and never seen the cuisine presented as elegantly as it is here. I have also not enjoyed such a complexity of flora. Indian sauces are complex but Kinaara    does something special. Make a reservation and enjoy a relaxed evening of delicious  food. 

More adventurous dishes include the broccoli, which is spicy and amazingly good. People who feel less adventurous can not go wrong with the Butter chicken. The garlic naan is exceptional. 

The first evening, we had a group of 7 and “Ashish” waited in us and the second evening , we were just a couple, returning to try more dishes and our waiter was “Roshaan.”  Both men are professional and very knowledgable about the wines and the cuisine.

It’s run by an enthusiastic young couple, who as they say, “are trying to put love in everything they do.” The menu is really interesting with novel...and creative approaches to traditional favorites. The meatballs, for example, can only be described as little soft pillows of meaty goodness…so so tasty. The eggplant parm is lovely with a pecorino fondue sauce that adds a velvety touch. They do a dessert that is essentially a deconstructed cannoli with some other twists. It was excellent. So are the various crostini which happen to be very generous in size. The wine selection is really nice  and they are very helpful in pairing with their menu items.

The menu consisted of regional dishes and flavors were deep and complex. Weeks later, we  still talk about the side dish of roasted egg plant that my wife and I shared. We tried to sample local wines when we were in Rome and enjoyed the one we had with our meal. It was an absolutely great evening from the amuse bouche to the dessert. What can I say when everything about each dish was perfect?
It may be difficult getting a taxi from the restaurant on a weekend night when many people are out at restaurants and bars in the area and the city for that matter.

Silvia, the co-owner and our hostess was extremely friendly and welcoming.  She walked us through the menu and...was patient and explained every item on the menu with the ingredients.

The food is not only tasty but very creative and unique.
El Confinado - it is like a mini slider that comes with edible plastic wrap.
Ses Illes - it is like a spring roll wrapped in an edible newspaper.  
The Tiramisu balls were the super hit of everyone and probably the best and most fun dessert we had. 
The experience, the ambience and the service was outstanding.
Highly recommend this place.

The menu was accessible using a code on the table. 
Variety of drinks but not the usual coke, Fanta, etc. We opted for carrot ginger...beer, and that was very nice. There are a mix of fruit mocktails available. Didn't look at the alcohol drinks. 
Cauliflower wings to start off with, accompanying dipping sauce, and we loved it. 
Blind Date burger was supposed to be so like meat you wouldn't be able to tell the difference. I would agree to disagree but it was delicious. Came with home cooked fries. 
The Oh My Hot Dog did taste just like a hot dog though. 
The food came quickly, as did the drinks. 
Efficient and friendly.
Only here for a week but will hopefully go back.

It was a little difficult to find. One reviewer here mentioned walking a path along the water...which the owner told us is the correct way to find it. We were not on that path and ended up walking through a campground, wondering if we were going to find the place. We almost gave up but I am glad we didn't because it was a great dinner.

"Restaurant Belvedere","Dorfstrasse 53 Hotel Belvedere Grindelwald, Grindelwald 3818 Switzerland","2","4.5","313","32.0","172.0","My wife and I went to Belvedere Restaurant for dinner last week and were excited based on all of the reviews highlighting this as one of the best restaurants in Grindelwald.

We could *not* have been more disappointed. We started out with what seemed like...a wonderful dinner on the terrace, but after we ordered, the dinner went quickly downhill. We were treated like we clearly did not matter at all.

Our waiter disappeared for close to an hour with no one else taking his place to serve us. He did not bring the wine we ordered for dinner and when my wife received her dinner from the server and was very disappointed in the fish, she could not get a single person's help to order another entree.

Making things worse, when someone finally approached our table after 45 minutes and noticed that she had not eaten any of her food, they insisted that we file a formal complaint with the manager so that we could received a discount or refund before we left.

What then actually happened was the worst experience I have ever had a restaurant. We were forced to wait another 30 minutes for the manager to come out to our table and interview my wife as to why she did not like her meal. She then took the dinner from my wife, offered nothing in its place, and disappeared leaving us to wait. After another 15 minutes she returned to tell my wife that everyone in the kitchen had tasted her food (seriously?!) and all agreed that the fish was indeed fresh and that she was wrong. 

During this entire time, we had simply been trying to cut our losses, get our bill, pay, and leave. But instead we waited close to 1.5 hours to receive disappointing food, be ignored by our waiter and the other wait staff, and then forced to talk to the manager only to be argued with told that my wife was wrong for not liking her meal. And at the end of it all, we were charged for the glass of wine they forgot to bring and charged in full for the dish my wife did not eat - despite being told that it would be discounted or removed from our bill.

Given how expensive the dinner was, I'm still astonished at how we miserably we were treated and the quality of the food. I've never experienced anything like this at a restaurant in my life, let alone one of such high regard. No one should ever be treated this way - it was humiliating and inexcusable.More","July 2022","NEGATIVE","0.07044081389904022","0.0027506283950060606","0.7316760420799255","0.1951325237751007","","7","2340"

When we came in to the restaurant, a lady came to take our orders. She told us that the kitchen was closing very soon hence we went through the menu...quickly to order, tho we had some questions and she became impatient, showed by her body gestures and sighs. She tried to maintain a friendly voice but we were already feeling very uncomfortable by her response as she was rushing to take our orders (they could’ve told us they were closing if they didn't want to take more orders). We ended up ordering big portions of the fish and chips and what they put as ‘steak’ on the menu.

We were super disappointed when the food arrived. The taste was okay but tbh it looked like frozen food. The ‘steak’ should be best translated as a beef burger patty instead. We were also surprised that they would charge for tab water (we later found 1 other restaurant in Switzerland who charges for tab water as well), and if we wanted to request for 1 more plate and fork. To be fair it was written on their menu but we missed it, still we felt it was quite ridiculous.

We would’ve been expecting a more pleasant experience in a service-based industry and treated with better customer respect, but instead we rushed to finish the food (just because we didn't want it to go wasted) and left feeling heated.More","May 2023","NEGATIVE","0.020273825153708458","0.004779596347361803","0.9624165892601013","0.012529870495200157","","5","1387"

My...wife and I both enjoyed fresh salads and fish plates.  The fish was caught in the adjacent lake, with crystal-clear water, and tasted delicious.  The beer is what you will find in other restaurants, and they also have liquor.

It's a small restaurant (probably seats 30 max) but has a real charm to it.  I could be mistaken, but it appears to be run by a husband and wife (could also be girlfriend).  In speaking with the chef/owner, we learned that is originally from Germany and cooked there for years before ""retiring"" to Switzerland.  His congeniality topped that of the waitress, and made for a great dining experience.  

As we walked back, we chalked up the hotel hostess' assessment of this restaurant as either not based upon experience, or biased (the hotel has its own restaurant).

"Graham's Kitchen","Hemonystraat 38, 1074 BS Amsterdam The Netherlands","1","5.0","773","","","Superb overall… Julia & I each had the 6-course dinner option and Chef Mee’s offerings proved to be very well presented, wonderfully tasting, and highly creative in terms of ingredients; for example, combining veal sweetbreads (cut chunk-style with a very light crust), with a couple...of shelled mussels,  Jerusalem endive (root chicory), and rhubarb?  Or what about firm tofu finished like a crème brulée as an accompaniment to some lightly-seasoned slices of Hamachi? 
The wine pairings were very fine matches for each course; original in their provenance (we had our first introduction to a very interesting Chardonnay from Hungary), balanced in terms of their acidity with respect to the food’s, and the pours were generous. The restaurant makes its own sparkling water with the end product being a water with a light ‘bite’ & very small bubbles, which is perfect to clean one’s palate between courses and pairing wines; the two of us actually went through two large bottles over the course of the evening… The ‘peasant bread’ (offered with most of the courses) is sourced directly from a vendor who understands what the restaurant wants to achieve, and the offering is a near-perfect balance between taste and texture that will last throughout the entire dinner experience. 
The waiting staff was very friendly —yet extremely professional— and could answer any question about the food and wines. Chef Mee took the time to meet us a couple of times (during short breaks) and provided further answers regarding the offerings. 
The settings are nice and comfy, offering decent privacy between tables and a relaxed atmosphere. Based on our experience, plan for *at least* 3 hours if you opt for the full 6-course menu with the paired wines and a relaxed dinner pace.
 Looking back at this wonderful dining event, the only negative that we can think of is the lack of a printed menu for the food & the paired wines that we could have taken home, as we would have liked to remember the exact details of our dining experience; had we be given one it would have ended-up in the top 2-3 pages of our album documenting the fine restaurants that we have been able to visit over the past 40 years.  Graham’s Kitchen is not just good, it’s *that* good, while also being an incredible value; with already 2 toques in G&M, it’s only a matter of time before it gets similar dues in the M-guide…  
If you are planning for a superb gastronomical experience, consider making a reservation soon; as far as we are concerned, Graham’s Kitchen made our ‘top-five’ and it will now be a required culinary stop every time we are in Amsterdam.More","November 2023","POSITIVE","0.9921814203262329","0.002123806159943342","0.002953252289444208","0.0027414881624281406","Amsterdam","11","2626"

Each course had that magical touch without the overt drama other high end establishments  try to bring.

The scallop course was described by my wife as the most amazing thing she had ever eaten and I would struggle to disagree.

"Sherpa Restaurant","Korte Leidsedwarsstraat 58, 1017 RD Amsterdam The Netherlands","3","4.5","1404","20.0","29.0","Our very first try at Tibetan cuisine., and it was absolutely fantastic... We had the Gyacok for 2 people: A mix of meat pieces (chicken and wonderfully-seasoned lamb), shrimps, Momos (steamed dumplings), and vegetables, served with basmati rice and thin noodles (like a vermicelli) in...a Tibetan steamer. We were offered a choice of ‘hotness’ level and we went for medium. The result is well-worth the 20 minutes extra preparation time as it is much lighter (fat-wise) than one would expect, and each individual morsel maintain its individual taste rather than the sauce/broth taking over.
We made the reservation a few weeks ago and our table was ready on time. Within 30 minutes there were many (maybe 20?) people waiting in line outside and that’s impressive as it was rainy!. A reservation is a must if you don’t want to wait. The wine list is very decent but we went for Cava Brut as we didn’t know what to expect in terms of how the food would taste, and it worked great. Service was efficient and friendly.
The overall ambiance and the decor are pretty basic. The chairs are comfortable, and the ambient noise levels do not interfere with private conversations. There are only two very small bathrooms.More","November 2023","POSITIVE","0.9774842858314514","0.011937081813812256","0.0021131031680852175","0.008465571328997612","Amsterdam","11","1215"

His choices were excellent- we had the pan seared chicken momo and onion bhaji as appetizers (onion bhaji was amazing) and shared the lamb Dal Bhat (a Nepalese dish we’d never tried before) and Chicken tikka masala for our main course. We finished off with extremely fresh and homemade tasting mango and coconut sorbet.

Plus this restaurant was very convenient location wise for our hotel. 
And it was simply amazing. 
Fairly small restaurant so I was grateful I booked in...advance as they were constantly turning people away. 
We had the speciality sharing steak to start which was cooked perfectly and tiramisu as dessert. A couple of drinks as well and it was fantastic value in my opinion for what we had. 
So good I booked again for the next evening. 
Had a different cut of steak this time but still to share and in my opinion it surpassed the previous evening in taste. Maybe one of the tastiest steaks I have had. 
Throw into the mix the service and their knowledge of the steaks etc albeit with a dodgy imitation cockney accent and it just added to the whole experience.

Well, 2 years later, we made it back and we were not disappointed.  This is a 14 seat, Michelin restaurant in a...Budapest apartment.  It is totally charming and the Host and Chef, and their staff are incredibly gracious.  The dishes are very creative and very beautiful.

I can't describe all of the food but I will high light some of it:
- It's fall, think pumpkin. Perfect dish for a cool night.
- Sturgeon soup - almost indescribably delicious.
- A gnochi like dish with mushrooms, pickeled mushrooms and egg? foam.
-Beef cheek (photo) paired with a Hungarian Temprranillo (melt in your mouth)
- Plus more and dessert.
- After dinner drinks (I had Palinka)

We did the Hungarian wine pairings and they were are very good.  They started with a wlecome sparkler that we really liked.  I recommend savoring your arrival with an additional bottle of that for about 5000 HF (US$15)

Service was great, well paced and each course was described in detail.

Set in an apartment (not obvious from outside) they’ve done a wonderful job at designing the restaurant to feel like home with a cosy and relaxed ambience. A lot of thought and care has gone into the detail. The kitchen is open and you can’t believe that just three people are capable of running this entire experience so slickly while creating such works of art in the tasting menu. They were so attentive with our drinks and checking in to have a chat about the food. It was incredibly personable and friendly. And the time between each course was perfect; relaxed and yet on it all the same. Like a true dinner party setting in your home! Please continue to honour your bookings and support gems like Zincenco who go out their way to offer a culinary experience like no other, with brilliantly sourced fresh produce and a menu that has been well thought through.More","October 2023","POSITIVE","0.9953793287277222","0.004271055106073618","0.0002736675669439137","7.601452671224251e-05","Budapest","10","1261"

What an incredible evening we had. Exclusive but cosy “dinner party” ambiance with exceptional food. Each dish stunningly plated and personally presented to each table by either Igor or Zaida....They are so joyously passionate about what they do and are clearly proud (and should be) of what they have created. I cannot fault any of the food and each course was paired perfectly with a Hungarian wine. I loved all of it and every minute of the four and a bit hours we dined here was sublime. 
I have eaten at many wonderful restaurants but this is one of the greatest culinary experiences I have ever  had.

Happily our experience if...anything surpassed that high bar, with every aspect of our evening being just about perfect.

First the staff - our waiter and waitress were incredibly welcoming and attentive throughout our visit, explaining first the menu and then each dish (when served) in brilliant detail and adding hugely to the evening.

But the star of the show was undoubtedly the food - the menu is limited, with just four starters, mains and desserts, but our choices (and we guess those of other enjoying the same quality of food that evening) were each superb. My egg parfait with mushrooms was tasty, light and fresh, while my wife's goat cheese tartlet was a delicate delight.  The mains - an extraordinary rice dish and a beautifully cooked fillet of turbot were a treat both for the taste-buds and the eyes - the sauce with the turbot being a masterpiece of presentation. 

Add to that a dish of great cheeses and an exquisite apple tart (and some excellently chosen wines), all enjoyed in a very cool and modern dining room with a bird's eye view of the kitchen - and it all added up to pretty much the perfect evening.

The only problem we had was that we ordered a bottle of water when we were eating dessert. The server brought the bottle, but left without opening it. By the time we got his attention again, we were ready to leave. We were trying to make sure he took the bottle off the check, but instead he hurriedly opened it.

2) our starters we got poached eggs with cauliflowers and sesam...crackers. A+
3) our main dish we chose pork and fish.
The pork was outstanding A. The fish dish we did not like as much, because the fish was a bit dry and the other ingredients were drenched in soya sauce C. Which is a pitty really because otherwise it would be a 5/5 score for us.
4) the desserts were wonderful, a cake with ice cream and white chocolate mousse w bananas, whipped cream and popcorn. A

The servers were very nice, maybe the only thing is that if you speak 0 french it can be a experience where you’ll have to have more patience.

The restaurant itself is very chique but i would put more art on the walls because it kinda feels cold and very white but thats my opinion.

Of course there are some...changes, but this is only normal and to a degree desirable : for one to stay current, one needs to keep adjusting and involving.

As a summary, I would say that Le Rabassier has stayed loyal and stable to their founding principles while they have evolved and strengthened, so the move from Sablon to Uccle has proven natural and fitting, giving them space for growth and to further prove their worth. Now based in the Pavillon Louis XV found in the parc du Wolvendael could simply not have been any more fitting, while there is some interesting potential for lovely meals outside in a future cosy terrace.

Service-wise, they are of the highest standard and attention as ever, with discretion, professionalism and kind accommodation of any arising needs.

Food-wise, the quality, robustness and copiousness of their menus is as consistent as ever, and always a pleasure to discover their seasonally varied dishes. Compared to competitors, their offer remains beyond competitive and qualitatively complete.
Location-wise, parking is overall more convenient than their previous location.

All in all, highly recommended without second thoughts and a place to discover / return. They were amazing in their previous location and they continue strong and equally amazing.

In particular, it is particularly nice to see how they evolve and implement...changes (from the dishes themselves as food to the plates and cutlery as material) while they stay loyal to certain central principles, ideas and concepts, thus everything revolving around these fundamental blocks. 

Speaking of changes, on a personal note, I would say that I miss the bread they used to have in the past, which resembled sourdough; on the other hand, it’s nice to have some changes from time to time and this particular comment is 100% subjective and a matter of personal preference, so it should not be perceived as criticism.

Overall, seeing this place full was a genuine pleasure in itself, because they deserve it, given the joy it brings to the customers as well as recognition of the effort the owners put into it; for that reason, booking in advance is highly recommended.

My only suggestion would...be to make the bowls a bit smaller, I was initially a bit shocked by the price, but it makes sense given the size of the dishes. I would have preferred if they were 15-20% smaller with a price to match, as I left feeling completely stuffed.

Quality of the ingredients was excellent throughout.   Entree was a veal dish, quality meat, well prepared, interesting classic recipe, attractively presented.   Desserts were top notch -- perhaps the best Tiramisu ever.   Wine list was lovely, mid-range for the most part, with plenty of selections including from Italy; a bit hard to find in Lisbon.

Secondly, if you try to reserve for the same or the next day and the tables are unavailable, leave the website and start to reserve again - the reservation website may be a little...glitchy and you may find your table.  This was our experience.  Thirdly, the sister restaurant to Il Mercado is right around the corner, we are told, and you might have a table there.
They had three specials the night we went: chestnut gnocchi, tagliatelle with mushrooms and black truffles and veal tenderloin.  Many other pastas were available.

We dined here because, after two weeks, we do not like traditional Lisbon restaurant cuisine.  The Thai restaurants are also a good quality change.

Our meal here started out with bread, olive oil, vinegar, olives and cheese.  The cheese was the same as one would get in a Portuguese tasca, so no improvement there - but the bread was focaccia and it was soft, appropriately moist and flavorful, a welcome change from the dry-ish and almost flavorless bread served in all of the tascas.  We ordered the caprese salad.  It was not a standout, but it was good.  The gnocchi and tagliatelle were flavorful, complex, balanced, in short: just right.  We did not leave room for dessert.  Our waiter poured us limoncellos and handed us the restaurant's card with his name written in.  It was Valentim, who is mentioned in so many of these Il Mercado reviews.More","November 2023","MIXED","0.024061577394604683","0.05057404190301895","0.18086697161197662","0.7444974184036255","Lisbon","11","1440"

They call it modern Indian food, and recommended me to order another dish when I said I like it hot. Fine, but it was far from hot. They then gave me something that seemed to be sriracha sauce, saying...that was how they handle spice requests as their food wasn't so hot, Let's call it Oslo kitchen, then. Two types of IPA, one with mango flavor, so, as my question wasn't understood, I took the risk of ordering ""juicy ipa"". It did live up to its name - quite disgusting taste in my mind.

We decided to give it a go because of the good reviews, and it didn't disappoint. First off, it was packed with locals, which is always a good sign if...you want to taste the real deal.

Our waiter, who was a super friendly guy from Bosnia, knew his stuff and gave us great recommendations. You've got to try the Toast Skagen and the Chèvre cheese—I even double-checked the menu to make sure I spelled them right for this review, they're that good.

As for the main course, the lamb fillet was perfect, and the wine pairings were spot-on. The side dishes were equally impressive; think beets and pumpkin done to perfection. A funny thing happened: I found myself enjoying my wife's dish more than my own. The waiter picked up on this and brought me an additional plate of the same dish my wife had, at no extra charge. It wasn't that my dish was lacking; hers was just that good.

Probably the most friendly staff of any restaurant in our 2 weeks in Scandinavia. We tried the Proscuito and Halloumi + the Garlic Bread to start. They were both great, but the Garlic bread was a bit much...considering they also brought out some excellent house bread with a cheese spread. Would recommend just sticking with this and trying another starter.

I ordered the Char filet and the girlfriend ordered the Fried Pork. The filet was solid, not as good as some other Char I’ve had in Scandinavia, but paired with their crushed potatoes and cabbage it’s a generous dish and quite good. The fried pork is literally super thick bacon cuts with Swedish pancakes. Super heavy, but some of the best pork and Swedish pancakes out there. Would recommend if you’re up for it.

Dining room having main table around the kitchen with open fire in the corner (little bit like...Saison in San Francisco) is very nice too. Service is professional, smooth and relaxed. But, I do not see passion and ambition here. The food and wine pairing is not the level of three star Michelin, unfortunately. It’s not bad, of course. On the contrary, it’s very good, but far away from Geranium, Maaemo and other 3 stars. It’s like El Celler de can Roca, excellent once, perhaps, but those days appear to be gone now.

We enjoyed everything from the first step thru the door with the welcoming staff directing us to the top floor for amuse-bouche...bites in a soft, relaxing environment. Here the ingredients are introduced and before moving downstairs to be seated in an open kitchen you are guided thru the place (& key staff). The set menu consists of seven courses, Japanese and French combined, with a wine package (there is a wine list for those that wants something extra but for me the Grande Vins were a great match to the menu), all presented in detail when served.

What strikes me was the young team of chefs and servants, all working as a great team, and of course the number - they were everywhere and very observant to provide the best service and experience with spending a reasonable amount of time and humor with each guest. Only critic would be in total, thru all courses, some were great and others just very delicious, and sometimes you got the feeling that the chefs and servants were reading thru a script. We were very impressed and happy with our experience.More","August 2023","POSITIVE","0.8185545802116394","0.1405705213546753","0.009699489921331406","0.0311754010617733","Stockholm","8","1200"
"Frantzén","Klara Norra Kyrkogata 26, Stockholm Sweden","3","5.0","201","","","The title says it all.

Before I begin, I feel like if you’re reviewing a place like this and being critical it is crucial to establish that you have some experience in this area.  And so whilst I have never been one to brag about...previous experiences, I can safely say I have lost count of the 3* places I’ve visited across the globe and so this review comes with some background at this level, it’s not just a case of this place was the wrong fit.

Let me begin with the good.  The guy who greeted us was fabulous, he had been there for many years, was very polite, had the right level of humour and was just overall a great guy.  This was a common theme with all the staff who worked there.  Polite, knowledgeable and clearly indoctrinated into the brand.  The only part where this was slightly uncomfortable was on the main dining environment where you could see how nervous some of the chefs were.  Almost as if they were too concerned of the consequences of putting  a finger wrong, you could sense the tension as you dined.

The decor in the place was good, nothing particularly outstanding but it was ok.  The layout was interesting and the whole
introduction to the ingredients you would be eating later seemed a bit worn out.  It also felt a bit like reading the plot to a novel on Wikipedia before sitting down to read the book itself.

The food itself was ok.  It wasn’t bad, but it also wasn’t memorable.  I’ve had better non-starred fine dining food, which is concerning of somewhere that’s supposed to hold 3*.  Of the three Michelin restaurants we dined at in Stockholm over the course of three nights, this one comfortably ranked last in our post trip lists.  I would say the bread was delicious,  but I feel like if you run a restaurant like this, the bread is probably not what you want to be remembered for.  Of the rest of the courses, seasoning seemed to be hit and miss as you went along.  The petit fours at the end of the meal also deserve an honourable mention for being outstanding.  Whoever your pastry chef is, pay them whatever they want to stay forever because they’re holding it together right now.

It’s worth noting that while we were dining there, the branch in Harrods had just opened so it may have been a case of eye off the ball leading to a sub par period in the flagship.

Now an explanation for the title of the review.  As we were dining it felt like being inducted into some sort of cult.  The guy next to us at one point was explaining how it had taken over a year and half for him to get a table.  It also had taken us some very quick form filling to acquire a table when it was released and before they had all sold out within 3 minutes of release.  I feel that all of this reservation hype had led to this atmosphere where everyone dining couldn’t help but be full of praise for the experience, perhaps because of the amount they had paid or perhaps because everyone else was seemingly enjoying it, but everybody was blindly signing up to this belief that this place was truly at the pinnacle of cuisine, when it simply was not.  It was simply very average, which is probably not where it aspires or hopes to be.More","December 2022","MIXED","0.1870020180940628","0.10663808882236481","0.12749594449996948","0.5788639187812805","Stockholm","12","3166"

At the top...floor, the maître d' is standing on the landing and he is not to leave my side for much time this evening.  The management has Googled me and it is eerie to have bits of my life discussed in conversation as I am being served. 

The restaurant looks like a Norwegian oil billionaire's log cabin.  -- Dated before it was furnished.  -- Not ugly, but a standard job by an interior decorator by coffee table books. 

The ingredients to be used tonight are presented in a show cabinet and small groups of us guests are invited to learn where the butter and salt along with the langoustine originate from.  -- Quaint if one has never seen fresh food, perhaps? 

Dish 1: White on a white plate. Dish 2: White on a white plate. Dish 3: White on a white plate.  -- I ask the maître d' why everything is WHITE.  A German woman next to me demands to know if I am a professional food critic, and I silence her with a stern stare. It is cramped. We are all squashed around a communal table. The man next to me is at the restaurant for the third time, I am made to hear from him, and his companion.  People are dressed in shorts and t-shirts.  I am the only person dining on my own, and naturally, dressed in a dark suit, shirt, and tie.  People are served in excess of five different sorts of wine.  -- Is this a wine tasting or a dinner? I ask myself.  

Dish 6 arrives and I tell the staff not to place the plate in front of me if what is on it is ALL WHITE. It is pain sucré, so it is (sort of)  white and the plate is refused.  At this point, the head of the restaurant rushes up to me and suggests I might want to end ""the experience"".  I am so glad he offered, as is the German woman next to me as she is not pleased to see me sending all food back to the kitchen.  I am gently nudged out of the door and there is nothing to pay. ""Tonight is on me"", says the maître d´as he locks the door with me standing on the doorsteps. USD 1,000 is extortionate money to pay to dine at this pedestrian eatery.  One should note that the Michelin stars are given by local inspectors, and thus are not handed out by an international committee of sorts. Frantzén might claim to be the best restaurant in Sweden, but it is a far cry from fine dining in London, Paris, and NYC.More","January 2022","NEUTRAL","0.23651310801506042","0.2861686050891876","0.23622076213359833","0.24109753966331482","Stockholm","1","2490"

The wonderful owners welcome you as family and provide a warm environment and an extraordinary meal. They personally seat you and take the time to explain the menu-even most ingredients. No detail has been overlooked. The menu took months to finalize. Allow them to recommend even your drinks to pair with your choice. We chose the three sampler pizzas and the Cesar salad. The owner suggested a Belgian raspberry beer that was unlike anything I’ve ever tried- (and my husband makes craft beer!) It was phenomenal! Think pink champagne - a perfect start - like Prosecco before the meal. We loved the fig/truffle pizza most of all—but they were all excellent. So just say yes and try this wonderful spot.

Once seated, our server put our minds at rest. He conferred with the chef, and together, we had...it all worked out. It made all the difference that I alerted the folks at Lupa about my allergies at the time of booking.

One dish I was unable to eat because of my allergy to the main ingredient. But it was wonderful to watch my partner enjoy it. I never felt left out, however, because all the other items on the tasting menu we ordered were sublime. And they were made for us to enjoy where the common ingredient was omitted just for me.

That kind of TLC from the chef and staff tells you how the kitchen prepares each dish from scratch. So, even if you can eat everything on the menu ""as is,"" it is important to know how hand-crafted each plate is by the time it arrives to your table.

The restaurant was awarded a green michelin star for aiming at waste reduction and sustainable sourcing, yet the food's taste is still the biggest focus. Creating strong, umami flavors with plants is not easy, but worked very well, especially with the mushroom dishes.

Overall if we hadn’t been to Bloom I think we’d have given it a 5 but honestly try Bloom first it’s so much better.More","November 2023","POSITIVE","0.6611388325691223","0.0014267276274040341","0.0775381550192833","0.25989633798599243","Copenhagen","11","731"

The best dish was asparagus creamy soup. Risotto with mushrooms was just on point.
Seabass could be a bit less grilled, but still very good.

Desert, raspberry trio, with...chocolate crumbles was genius.More","November 2023","POSITIVE","0.9996484518051147","0.00026690078084357083","2.9710728995269164e-05","5.491837509907782e-05","Copenhagen","11","318"

"Maple Casual Dining","Vesterbrogade 24, Copenhagen 1620 Denmark","5","5.0","759","","","This was a great choice for our first night in Copenhagen, buzzy and full even on a very wet Tuesday evening which tells you something. I found the portions on the tasting menu a bit large - full size main course which I couldn’t finish...- but the food was delicious and those with larger appetites will be happy. Only slight disappointment was the crème brûlée which was too runny underneath an excellent crust. Very nice service, would definitely recommend.More","October 2023","POSITIVE","0.8964558243751526","0.00015968862862791866","0.00040467182407155633","0.10297973453998566","Copenhagen","10","464"

We’d booked in advance, but my partner’s phone had broken, so we had to drop by earlier in the day to check the time of our booking. The staff member...was incredibly helpful and friendly and gave a warm welcome on our return a few hours later.

We had the muscles and the soup to start. Both dishes were delicious. Fresh and wonderfully presented. For our main courses we had the chicken thighs and the sea bass. Again, both dishes were full of flavour, fresh, and well-presented. We chose a bottle of Pinot Grigio to go with our dinner, which was a perfect accompaniment.

The staff were wonderfully welcoming and helpful, and we left feeling like regular visitors.

The biggest issue is getting a booking. I made 2 bookings a month ahead of...our visit and even with that much notice I could only get 6.30 dining times.
